            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Life of a Chriſtian is not onely Speculative but Active; (ſpeculation and action (like the Soul and Body) attend each other in performing the Duties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.) The moſt Wiſe God hath ordered and determined a ſet time for Man upon earth, to fit and prepare himſelf for an everlaſting condition; how then are we all concern'd to redeem that ſhort time we have allowed us, (which we know not how ſoon may be taken from us) to enter into a ſtrict exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of our wayes, knowing that one day all our thoughts, words, and actions (even our moſt
<pb facs="tcp:98496:3"/>retired and ſecret ſins) ſhall be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the view both of Men and Angels. O Time, one of the moſt glorious things that ever God made, how many bleſſed and glorious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are now in Heaven for making a right uſe of thee? And how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny damned Ghoſts are now in Hell for abuſing thee, who would now give a thouſand worlds (had they ſo many to diſpoſe of) for to have that opportunity we now enjoy, to improve thee? For mine own part I am but a yong Man, who came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world but as yeſterday, &amp; ere to morrow (for ought I know) may be taken hence: For how many dayes are alloted me upon Earth, none but the Ancient of days know; wherefore during my continuance in this Tabernacle, I deſire to walk circumſpectly, that when my Lord ſhall come to call me to a reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I may (like a good ſteward) be found faithful of the charge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb facs="tcp:98496:3"/>to me. You know his doom, that hid his Talent in a Napkin.</p>
            <p>It was in this conſideration that I did now put Pen to Paper, and raiſed my contemplations above the things of this world, to thoſe of a better, in order to the gaining and attaining a right and title to that glorious, undefiled, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fading Inheritance, purchaſte for Believers in the higheſt Heavens.</p>
            <p>Let not any taxe me of Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for expoſing my Lines to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like view, and my ſelf to open Cenſure; 'Twas not to get me a Name, but to further the weak Chriſtian in his approaches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven. Neither let any contemn the Work of this Author, for the Author of this Work; but remember that God can by weal means perform great matters. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens (thoſe unclean Birds by the Law) were Caterers to <hi>Elijah</hi> in his
<pb facs="tcp:98496:4"/>extremity at the Brook <hi>Cherith,</hi> brought him bread and meat to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain him, he neither ſcorn'd thoſe ſtrange kinde of Purveyors, or the Viands which they brought, but admired the hand that ſent it. The Gifts and Graces of Gods Spirit are not to be ſlighted where ever found; I ſpeak not this by way of Oſtentation, but with a deſire that my Readers would judiciouſly read, ere they raſhly cenſure; and inſtead of carping at my failings, correct their own; that Love, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a multitude of faults, may caſt the favourableſt conſtruction on mine. 'Tis Charity to judge well of others, and Piety to look well to our ſelves. If any thing of worth appear in me more then in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perſon upon earth, attribute it to him who is the giver of every good and perfect gift. What have we that we have not received.</p>
            <p>And let me further requeſt you,
<pb facs="tcp:98496:4"/>that after the claſhing of Armor, thunderings of Canons, ſound of Drums, and the alarm of Trumpets, you would (in this your day) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after your everlaſting Peace, and conteſt no longer about Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Circumſtances, and Shadows (not worth contending for) but for that one thing neceſſary, which will reward your labours with no leſs then a Crown.</p>
            <p>Our preſent diviſion is a ſad Omen of our future miſeries, and our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y unity would abundantly faciliate our deſired felicity: I wiſh we did all practiſe what we all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, Faith and Love; we ſhould all procure what we all deſire, Truth and Peace: were we all uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Tri-une-God, we ſhould not be thus divided one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. The Lord in his good time compoſe all our Differences, that Malice, Errour, and Debate may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the curſed Womb, whence
<pb facs="tcp:98496:5"/>they deriv'd; and all our Strife may end in this, to excel each other in the power of Godlineſs, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Love.</p>
            <p>For my Concluſion, let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt you to vouchſafe a ſerious peruſal of this ſmall Manual, and the Lord make it (in ſome meaſure) beneficial to you, (for next the Glory of God, your good is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aimed at by the Author.) And if this finde civil entetainment, I ſhall (if God prolong my life, to finiſh what I have begun) preſent you with ſomething elſe.

               <p>THis Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the firſt twelve Chapters preſents us with the Hiſtory of the Worlds Creation, the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> the deſolation of the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, the replanting a new World, and the confuſion of Languages. From the twelfth Chapter to the five and twentieth, you have the Hiſtory of the Patriarch <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> whoſe many trials and troubles (ſo
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98496:9"/>chearfully underwent, and ſo patiently indured for God) doth ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate his zeal and proclaims his praiſes to ſucceeding generations (as a worthy preſident for after ages.) We firſt finde that he was the Son of <hi>Terah,</hi> and what <hi>Terah</hi> was, and where he lived, is ſoon found, and as eaſily determined. <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> was a ſtranger to the true God, and a ſerver of ſtrange Gods, (Idols and no Gods) Gods made with hands, even the Gods of the Nations, and he lived on the other ſide of <hi>Jordan,</hi> where <hi>Abrahams</hi> God was neither worſhipt nor known: <hi>Abraham</hi> the ſon of ſuch a Father, of ſuch an Idolatrous Family, and Nation, is ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by be moſt high God (as yet unknown to <hi>Abraham</hi>) to leave his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, kindred, and Fathers houſe, to go into a Land that he would ſhew him. This was a ſtrange kinde of injunction, what? to leave his Fathers houſe, his near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and his dear countrey, to wait upon the commands of a God, whom neither himſelf or his Father ever knew, to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a voluntary exile, he knew not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (and for he knew not what!) <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> thought it his greateſt miſery to be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98496:9"/>baniſht his native ſoil, and thought all airs odious but that in which he firſt breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The <hi>Perſians</hi> were better pleaſed with beholding the ſmoak of their own chimneys then with the greateſt honours of forreign Countreys; yet <hi>Abraham</hi> readily forſakes all for God, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attends his commands, (though he knew neither the aim or end of his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;) he ſtood not to diſpute the caſe with God, but conform'd himſelf to the will of God, and ſteered his courſe by the Card of his directions; ſo to the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> (in the courſe of his obedience) at laſt he comes; (that Land flowing with Milk and Honey, (after for his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs) was the inheritance of his ſeed.) From thence he paſſes into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and no ſooner is he arived there, but his Wives beauty occaſions his diſcontent; the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> takes her from him: ſhe is no ſooner reſtored him, but forth of <hi>Egypt</hi> he goes, and now another miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance befalls him. The increaſe of his Flocks occaſion a difference 'twixt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felf and his kinſman <hi>Lot,</hi> (or rather 'twixt their Herdſmen) but having wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and happily made up this breach, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98496:10"/>
                  <hi>Lot</hi> no ſooner ſettled in the fertile plains of <hi>Sodom,</hi> but is taken priſoner by the Kings of <hi>Elam, Shinar, Ellaſar,</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> King of Nations. And now <hi>Abraham</hi> is as much perplext about his Coſins Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue, as he was before in compoſing the difference, 'twixt their Herdſmen: well having waded through this difficulty alſo, and though a rich man, and now at peace, ſomething is yet wanting to crown his wealth; his Wife <hi>Sarah</hi> (though fair) is barren, and he thinks God deals very hardly with him in denying him a Son to poſſeſs that after him, which by Gods providence and his own dilligence he had brought together. At laſt (in part to gratifie his deſires) God gives him a Son, but ſuch a one as the Jews define him, a Son and no Son, an <hi>Iſhmael</hi> not an <hi>Iſaac;</hi> not the promiſed Son, not he in whom all the Nations of the World ſhould be bleſſed. At laſt he hath an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but that he might not want a continual ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of croſſes to try his faith, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his patience, his Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> (ſo long promiſed, and with ſuch longing expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deſired) muſt die, and a violent and cruel death muſt put a period to his new
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98496:10"/>life: to the further aggravation of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, <hi>Abrahams</hi> hands muſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute him and ſhew himſelf not a Father but a Murderer; and no ſooner had God prepared a Ram for <hi>Iſaacs</hi> reſcue, but <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt baniſh <hi>Hagar</hi> and his Son <hi>Iſhmael;</hi> and no ſooner is this over, and the tears wipt from his eyes, but behold a greater miſchance (like <hi>Jobs</hi> meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers) comes in the neck of it; his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Sarah</hi> dyes in <hi>Hebron,</hi> in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in the hundred and twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth year of her age, whereupon <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> with his heart full of grief, and his eyes full of tears, makes his Apology to the Sons of <hi>Heth,</hi> for a burying-place for <hi>Sarah;</hi> and that he might the better ſpeed in this his ſo reaſonable and ſeaſonable requeſt, he ſuits his expreſſions in the garb of the Text; <hi>I am a ſtranger and a ſojourner among you; Give me a poſſeſſion of a burying-place, that I may bury my dead out of my ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I could take this Scripture by the four corners (like that ſheet that was let down to Saint <hi>Peter</hi>) and preſent you with a four-fold diſcourſe, of Death, of Tears, of Pilgrimage, and the Grave: firſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98496:11"/>of death, <hi>and Sarah dyed.</hi> Secondly, of tears, <hi>and Abraham wept for Sarah.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of Pilgrimage, here's <hi>Abraham</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding his condition. Fourthly, of the Grave, here is <hi>Abraham</hi> purchaſing a Grave for <hi>Sarah,</hi> which is the Pilgrims Manſion, or the houſe of Death: but I ſhall ſingle out one of theſe, and onely keep to that, <hi>viz. Abrahams</hi> Profeſſion, as being moſt ſutable to my condition, and all of yours, (the Readers) <hi>I am a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and a Sojourner among you.</hi> But was this language for <hi>Abraham</hi> when treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Hittites</hi> for <hi>Sarahs</hi> Grave, to diſcourſe of his own mortality, or what is this his profeſſion of his own condition to the obtaining his requeſt of them? had it not been more proper for him to have ſet forth himſelf in the equipage of a Prince, then in ſo low a form, as that of a Pilgrim, as being moſt ſutable for ſo great a perſon. Mean men ſeldome crave when they have money in their hands to buy; and great men are apt to command: how comes it then to paſs that ſo eminent a perſon as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhrouds himſelf under ſo low a ſtile as that of a Sojourner?</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:98496:11"/>
               <p>Is not this that <hi>Abraham</hi> that was the ſon of <hi>Terah,</hi> the brother of <hi>Nahor,</hi> the Father of the faithful, and the friend of God; that was famous for many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent graces that ſhined in him? he was famons for his Faith, famous for his Hope, and famous for his Charity.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he was famous for his Faith, in obeying the Commands of a God, then ſtrange to him, and leaving his Fathers houſe to wander in a ſtrange Land, and expoſe himſelf to all the hazards and hardſhips, as uſually attend ſuch Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys; and to go ſo far out of his own knowledge to a Country unknown both to himſelf and his Fathers. Again, he was famous for his Faith, in not miſtruſting Gods omnipotency, in that he did ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly believe that God was able to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en <hi>Sarahs</hi> dead Womb, to bring him a Son in his old age; and when God ſent him that Son, (ſo long deſired, expected, and prayed for, to be the hope of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, out of whoſe Loins (according to the fleſh) the Saviour of the World was to proceed;) and when God commanded him to take this Son, (<hi>Abrahams</hi> Joy and <hi>Sarahs</hi> Jewel, conceived beyond Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and born to do great things) and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98496:12"/>with his own hands to butcher him. Here was the tryal of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, and an injunction above the grant of nature, had it been but an ordinary private perſon, whoſe birth had not been attended withſo many remarkable Promiſes and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, yet even in this, to one that had both Promiſes and Prophecies of future happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience eccho's to Gods Commands, though 'twere to fruſtrate and make void thoſe former predictions: <hi>Abraham</hi> was confident that if God ſhould take this from him, he was able to raiſe him another out of his aſhes. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity may adinire his faithfulneſs, but not parallel it.</p>
               <p>Secondly he was famous for his Hope, in that he was aſſuredly confident that not one Word from God ſhould fall to the ground unaccompliſht, but that he would make good all thoſe gracions promiſes he had made; that he ſhould be Lord of that famous and flouriſhing Countrey the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that his ſeed ſhould poſſeſs it; and that in them ſhould all the Nations of the world be bleſſed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, famous for his Charity; firſt, to his ſervants in general: <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>that Abraham will inſtruct his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98496:12"/>&amp;c.</hi> Famous for his love to one, in that he intented to make him Heir of his houſe; famous for his love to <hi>Hagar,</hi> in that he parted not with her without tears, though he had Gods approbation for her baniſhment: famous for his love to his Nephew <hi>Lot,</hi> in that he would not admit of any diſcord 'twixt their herdſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and hazarded his life to reſcue him out of the hands of thoſe Triumphant Kings that took him captive: famous for his love to his Son <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> in praying ſo cordially for him; <hi>Oh that Iſhmael might live in thy ſight:</hi> famous for his love to his Sons by <hi>Keturah,</hi> in giving them their portions when he ſent them away: famous for his love to his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in making him Heir of all his wealth: Laſtly, famous for his love to his Wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> (for his reſpect to her living, and that living affection to her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory which out-lived her) as appears by the Religious care he had to purchaſe her a Grave, (in that Countrey which their poſterity were after to be Lords of) which as he would not without coſt, ſo he could not treat of it without tears. Then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> ſtood up from before his dead, (where he had been weeping) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98496:13"/>the Sons of <hi>Heth</hi> to ſell him a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying place, that he might bury his dead out of his ſight: he was famous for his uprightneſs, in that he would not take to the value of a ſhoe-latchet from thoſe heathen Kings whoſe perſons, and all they had, were at his diſpoſal, as the ſpoil of war: Famous for his near and dear Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, in that he talkt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly with him as a man with his friend. (In a word) he was a man ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, that before him the world had not his fellow, nor hath it ſince ſcarce pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't his parallel; yet in courting the Sons of <hi>Heth,</hi> he ſets forth himſelf in no other language then this, <hi>I am a ſtranger and a ſojourner among you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence we are to obſerve, that here the beſt of men are but Pilgrims; the truth of which the Scriptures doth abundantly confirme: witneſs old <hi>Jacob,</hi> who being brought into King <hi>Pharaohs</hi> preſence, makes an ingenious confeſſion; Few and evil have been the dayes of thy ſervants Pilgrimage, and have not attained to the dayes of my Fathers in their Pilgrimage; (ſo his Fathers were Pilgrims as well as he.) <hi>Job</hi> cries out that his dayes are ſwifter then the ſwifteſt creatures; either
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98496:13"/>in the Earth, Air, or Sea, then an Eagle, Poſte, or ſhip; and tells us, that man that is born of a woman is of few dayes, and full of trouble. A life no leſs ſhort then painful, ſhort enough, for 'tis meaſured out not by weeks, moneths, or years, but dayes, and miſerable too; for 'tis as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for frail mortalls to be ſufferers, as for ſparks to fly upwards. And <hi>David</hi> being ready to take his laſt farewel of this world, ſaith, I go the way of all the earth; intimating that all men, as well as he, were to paſs through the gates of death; expreſſing the condition of his Fathers to be nothing different from his; <hi>I am a ſtranger and a ſojourner with thee, as all my Fathers were. Iſaiah</hi> proclaims all fleſh to be graſs, and their glory as fading, as the flower of the field: and this great <hi>Patriarck</hi> in the text, <hi>I am a ſtranger and a ſojourner among you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence we may further obſerve that the Saints of God in all ages (being through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſt of their own mortality) have ever entertained the meaneſt thoughts of themſelves: <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtiles himſelf duſt and aſhes; <hi>Jacob</hi> tearms himſelf, leſs then the leaſt of Gods bleſſings; <hi>David,</hi> a worm and no man; and the Son of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98496:14"/>
                  <hi>David</hi> expreſſeth himſelf low enough, or beneath himſelf, (as ſome think, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in theſe dayes deride and ſcorn the title) I the preacher was King in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. Iſaiah,</hi> a man of polluted lips. <hi>Jer.</hi> a child. And the great Doctor of the Gentiles, the leaſt of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>How hard a leſſon is this to learn, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is a grace contrary to moſt mens humors, out of faſhion, or at leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt in theſe times; for now moſt men offer that violence to modeſty, as to make their tongues the trumpets of their own praiſes, (though they have none to brag of.) He is no body that cannot ſet forth himſelf without anothers help, and on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſmooth up others too with titles above their deſervings. When King <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> paſt by the Grave of that Old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, he demanded what Inſcription that was; and may not we be as well ſtartled at the inſcribing and attributing high titles to popular greatneſs (beyond the lines, either of civility to tender, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility to accept) which argues the givers folly, and the receivers pride. Young <hi>Elihu</hi> was of a better minde, he would not give high titles to any, leſt his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in fury ſhould ſnatch him away. <hi>Job</hi> 32.22.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98496:14"/>
               <p>Thus having ſhewed what we are; (that we are all ſtrangers and ſojourners up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth) I now come to ſhew what we are to do, and in order to the making our Pilgrimage happy, and ſafely to arive at the bleſſed home, as will make thoſe eternally ſo that reach it; be pleaſed to take notice of theſe five directions,</p>

Travellers uſe not to ſtand gazing or loitering on the way, or to be drawn aſide to behold Novelties; they riſe up early and come to their Inne late, and travel hard to get home-wards; nor are they ſatisfied till they reach it. And ſhall not we that are Chriſtians (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a better account) be as mindeful of our home; it being ſuch a home that as far tranſcends the ſtatelieſt habitation here, as the higheſt Heavens doth the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98496:15"/>earth; ſuch a home as the quickeſt and ſharpeſt eye would be dazied with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding but a Glimpſe of its glory, and the eloquenteſt tongue or pen (that ever was) comes infinitely ſhort to deſcribe it. The great Apoſtle (who had once a view of that glory) comes ſomething near in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing it, (but 'tis in the negative, what 'tis not, not what 'tis:) for (ſaith he) Eye hath ſeen, nor ear heard, or the capacity of man apprehend the ſplendor of it. 'Tis ſuch a home as all the Patriarchs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Saints of God in all ages have left all to enquire after. This was the City to come, which they had ever in their eye, and wandred about in Sheeps-skins and Goat-skins, deſtitute, afflicted, and tormented to finde out. 'Tis ſuch a home where you ſhall never be troubled with any loathed ſociety, and your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved company, ſhall never be taken from you. No ſtrugling of enemies there; no <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Iſhbeſheth</hi> to contend for one Crown; for none but Conquerors; all heads ſhall be adorn'd with Crowns of glory, ſuch as never incircled the Temples of any earthly Monarch. 'Tis ſuch a home where Satan, nor any of his inſtruments ſhall be ever able to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98496:15"/>no ſiding or taking of parts there; no Schiſms or Diviſions; no room for Make-bates there: What ſhould ſuch Salamanders do in Heaven? there's a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter place prepared for ſuch hot ſpirits, (and 'twere well for them if one heat would extinguiſh another) for fire and brimſtone muſt be the portion of their cup. This place is onely for friends to dwell together in unity, and none admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here, but thoſe that live in peace; here muſt be no ſpirit of Contradiction, no diſſenting Brethren, no Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts there, but an unanimous conformity in all; becauſe that here is the God of Peace, and the Peace of God which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all underſtanding. 'Tis ſuch a home, where you ſhall forthwith behold and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the glorious beatifical Viſion, and be eternally unriddling that Myſtery which Mortality could never reach to, nor Reaſon apprehend, the Tri-une-God, the Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity. There you ſhall ſee the Lamb with his train of Attendants, Cherubims, Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims, Principalities, Powers, Thrones, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, Archangels, and Angels, Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, and Confeſſours, crying, <hi>Holy, holy, holy Lord
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98496:16"/>God of Sabbath:</hi> And there ſhall thoſe good Angels which were your Guardians upon earth, be your everlaſting Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in Heaven. (In a word) 'tis ſuch a home where you ſhall be made perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy; Time ſhall not ruſt or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh your glory, nor adverſity with her frowns, ever approach near thoſe Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; for you ſhall be ever in the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine of Gods favour, and your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as everlaſting as his that made it.</p>
               <p>Oh! did we but all conſider the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſweeteſt pleaſure here, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of thoſe endleſs and eternal joyes that the Saints ſhall there partake of, and the ſhortneſs and ſmallneſs of the longeſt and greateſt miſery or torture that can be endured here, to the Worm that never dyes, to the fire that is never quencht, to thoſe everlaſting torments that ſhall in full viols be poured upon the wicked in Hell for ever; we ſhould think leſs of this world, and more to be happy in a better. And this brings me from the firſt particular obſervable, to the ſecond. From being mindful of our home, to our choice of Guides to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct us thither.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chooſe the beſt guides.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:98496:16"/>
               <p>Theſe guides are in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment called Seers, in the New Overſeers; and theſe are they whom God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to lead us the way to that home, to which many Saints are already gone in Soul, and many more ſhall in Gods due time arive, and be fully glorified both in ſoul and body. Theſe Seers or Overſeers are thoſe that open the Scriptures, and make plain the way of the Lord, and cauſe his paths to be known to the ſons of men; they are alſo (for their dignity) term'd Ambaſſadors of Chriſt. Chriſts Stewards, Publiſhers of glad Tidings, proclaimers of Salvation, Fellow-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers together with Chriſt, and Miniſters of the Goſpel. Theſe God hath ſet up as lights, that by their ſoundneſs of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Integrity of life, many Souls may be recalled from darkneſs unto his marvellous light: they are Cities ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Hill for men to ſee, and Candles lighted upon candleſticks to light the Traveller the way; and theſe (by their eminency) are (or at leaſt ought to be) Men of excellent qualifications, and rare endowments; (Angelicall perſons, men made up of Heaven) and if we take ſuch
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98496:17"/>for our guides: we need not fear crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paths, but may be confident of our way. But becauſe all is not Gold that gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, nor all ſuch as they ſeem, it behoves us to be very cautious in the choiſe of our guides; for if the blinde lead the blinde, whither will they go? The way to Hell is broad and eaſily found, 'tis a pleaſant way beſet with Roſes, able to intice the fooliſh Traveller, who is ignorant that it leads to death. And on the contrary, the way to heaven ſeems to fleſh and blood very uncomfortable; a narrow ſharp, ſteep, and unpleaſant way, very intricate, long, tedious troubleſome and hard to finde; in which many a paſſenger hath ſtumbled, and many a blinde guide loſt his way. But that we may be warned by others harms, and reach that which they fell ſhort of; let's bear with the ſharpneſs of the way, and be incouraged by the happineſs of the end. The advice of a late ingenuous Author, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is worthy your obſervation. Regard not (ſaith he) how difficult the paſſage is, but whither it tends; nor how delicate the journey is, but where it ends. If it be eaſie, ſuſpect, it if hard, endure it. He that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98496:17"/>cannot excuſe a bad way, accuſeh this own ſloth; and he that ſticks in a bad paſſage, can never attain a good journeyes end. It cannot be denyed, but that many a paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hath ſuffered by bad guides, ſuch as have let them go out of their way, and made them believe the pleaſanteſt way was the beſt; and the poor Traveller not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the miſtake, till it hath been too late to talk of returning. But of ſuch we are cautioned to beware; and though they ſpeak never ſo ſmoothly, This is the way walk in it, we are to turn our deaf ear to erring Charms of ſuch blinde guides and witleſs Councellours. And this brings me from the ſecond particular obſervable, to the third; from the choice of our guides, to our haſte in ſetting out, and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in our courſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Set out betimes, and hold out to the end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As this Exhortation is two-fold, ſo ſhall be my diſcourſe upon it. I ſhall in the firſt place apply my ſelf to young men, who (like my ſelf) are but newly riſen, or ſcarce ſet out. And in the next, humbly addreſs my ſelf to aged perſons, who are (or at leaſt ought to be) near their journeys end.</p>
               <p>And firſt to young men, let me requeſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98496:18"/>you to make God and Heaven the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant objects of your thoughts; the one of your fear, the other of your love; ſo walk that ye diſpleaſe not the one, and ye need not fear the attaining of the other. Are you ſetting out, loſe no time, remember that many have ſquandred away the morning, and have not reacht their journeyes end ere night; and with thoſe fooliſh Virgins for their tardineſs, have been excommunicated that place of repoſe, where the early Traveller ſafely and in good time ariv'd. An hour in the morning (you know) is worth two at night; and God is better pleaſed with young Zeal then decreped Holineſs. <hi>Joſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi> forwardneſs makes him renown'd to poſterity, and young <hi>Timothy's</hi> Piety eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizes his name to future generations. Are you on your way, perſevere in your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian courſe, and think upon the end whilſt ye are at the beginnings (and even now upon the race, have an eye to the recompence) ſo ſhall the ſplendid glory of the one faciliate the irkſome tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the other. Every true Chriſtian (ſaith a learned writer) is a Traveller: His life, his walk; Chriſt his way, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98496:18"/>Heaven his home: his walk painful, his way perfect, his home pleaſing. Let's not therefore loiter, leſt we come ſhort of home; nor wander, leſt we come wide of home; but be content to travel hard, and to be ſure to walk aright, ſo ſhall our ſafe way find its end at home, and our painful walk, make our home welcome. We are all concerned to make our beſt uſe of time, leſt (too late) we lament the abuſe of it; yeſterday cannot be recalled, to morrow cannot be aſſured, to day therefore is onely ours, which if we ſlight, we loſe; which loſt, is loſt for ever. Young men, remember this, I mean you, whoſe bodies are ſtrong and healthful, not beſet with any ſickneſs or beſieg'd with any diſeaſes, nor loaded with thoſe common infirmities incident to old age; conſider that you know not how ſhort your time is, your Sun (for any thing you know, may go down in the morning, and your night may fall ere noon. Therefore be early up, and earneſt on your way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards home; that if death ſhall ſnatch you away in a moment, it may be, onely to waft you to happineſs, whilſt ye are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after it. <hi>David</hi> roſe up early in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98496:19"/>the morning and was earneſt in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after this <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he long'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, panted for it, and perpetually did he (during his tedious Pilgrimage in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſech</hi>) lift up his hands, with his ſoul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it. The Father of the Faithful roſe up early too, and did chearfully ſet out and held out to the end, as all thoſe muſt do that hope to reach his boſom. Ile now leave the young man on his march, and after a good beginning expect a Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in well doing, and a happy concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And now come and direct my ſpeech to the Ancients, even to you whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creped bodies, ſignifie your night at hand, when you ſhall lie down in the duſt, and reſt in oblivion, till the laſt Trumpet ſhall ſummon you before that dreadful tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Let me humbly requeſt you now to be inquiſitive after the other world; have you trifled away the morning of your day, and all this while not put one foot forward on your journey for Heaven. Let me acquaint you, that it may not now be too late, if you defer no longer; remember, there were ſome called at the third hour, as well as at the firſt; and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourors entertained in the evening that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98496:19"/>were rewarded with thoſe that came in the morning. Are you on your way, go chearfully along, and you may yet finiſh the work of the day ere the approaches of the night; wherefore be not weary of well doing, but remember that the end crowns the work; and he onely the gainer who endures to the end. How many have ſet out betimes and made a promiſing beginning, that have fainted on their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and fallen ſhort of Heaven; that which hath a diadem in the end, may well admit ſome bitterneſs in the beginning. Let therefore the worth of the reward promp you in your greateſt difficulties to undergo all with patience; who would not do much for ſuch a crown, and what will not ſome do for a worſe?</p>
               <p>In Races, all preſs towards the mark, but the foremoſt onely wins the prize. Not ſo here; here's a reward for every one that deſerves it, a prize for more then the foremoſt; not onely he that runs ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and is ſooneſt there, but every one that runs well (though he comes behinde) ſhall have ſomething. My advice to you is, that you would ſo prepare your ſelves in the evening of your day, for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98496:20"/>of your night, that all things being ready for a change, you may court death to convey you from the work to the reward. And it may not unfitly be ſaid of you, as of that glorious courſer of Heaven, <hi>The Sun knoweth his going down:</hi> and your ſetting here, may but make you rebound to ſhine more glorious in a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Sphere. And this brings me from the third particular obſervable, to the fourth; from our haſte in ſetting out and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in our walk, to the choice of our Comrades to accompany us in our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sort your ſelves with the beſt company.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Remember thou art a Kings Son, (ſaid <hi>Mindemus</hi> to his Pupil) ſo ſay I to thee, Chriſtian Reader, thou art ſon to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er King then <hi>Mindemus</hi> was, and wilt thou undervaluethy ſelf with baſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? ſhall one ſo nearly allyed to the Prince of Light, be a companion for a brat of darkneſs; an heir of Heaven, for a firebrand of Hell; the ſon of a King, for the ſlave of a Devil. It may be gueſt by the company we keep to whom we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, for birds of a feather will flock to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (ſayes our comon Proverb) 'Tis
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98496:20"/>moſt certain that nothing of good can be gained by bad company; and to ſhun the workers of evil, is the way to decline an evil work for we are apt to be drawn; more by example then precept, and to intimate thoſe we have moſt converſe with (be it to good or evil;) better there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to have no company at all, then not have good. I had rather go to Heaven alone, then to Hell with company. How then are we all concern'd to make choice of ſuch religious conſorts, as by their Heaven-like converſations may draw us to a trade of godlineſs, ſuch as may be thought fit (by the moſt wiſe God) to be both our companions upon earth, and with us to be admitted Denizons of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. To keep company with our betters, is the way to improve our ſelves; for as a late Author wittily obſerves, that to be beſt in the company, is the way to grow worſe; and the beſt means to grow bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is to be the worſt there. If therefore you have choſen ſuch, endear your ſelves each to other; for there's no ſuch friend to a tedious journey as a good compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and let your ſouls be (as it were) linkt in the bonds of true friendſhip, that

And like the ſame <hi>David</hi> ye may bid defiance to the works and workers of iniquity, with a depart from me ye wicked; ſo ſhall ye clearly quit your ſelves from the number of thoſe that ſhall at the laſt day be terrified with that direful excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the great judge. Depart from me, for I know you not. And this brings me from the fourth particular obſervable, to the fifth; from the choice of our company, to our deportment in our journey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take heed that ye fall not out by the way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For brethren and fellow ſo journers to diſagree is againſt the rules both of Piety and Policy; ſmall harmony nor delight in that journey where Travellers do jangle. When two <hi>Iſraelites</hi> fell at variance, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> a ſpectator of the diſcord, uſeth no other arguments of perſwaſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and appeaſe the difference, then this. <hi>Sirs, ye are Brethren;</hi> intimating that 'twas not for brethren to wrong one another. The Father of the Faithful how tender was he in preſerving friendſhip with his Nephew <hi>Lot. Let there be no ſtrife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98496:22"/>me and thee, for we be brethren.</hi> What manner of men were thoſe whom ye ſlew at Tabor (ſaid <hi>Gideon</hi> to <hi>Zeba</hi> and <hi>Zalmunna</hi>) Oh! they were my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. <hi>Oh! had you favoured them, I ſhould have ſpared you. For my Brethren and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions ſake,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>I will wiſh thee proſperity.</hi> 'Tis for enemies to fall out, not for ſuch near and dear allyes to diſagree; they muſt hold together, live together, and walk together in love, as being related in an higher and nobler ſenſe then that of Nature; being fellows of one family, Sons of one Father, Children of one Mother, Stones of one Building, Branches of one Vine, Sheep of one Fold, Members of one Body, and Profeſſors of one Truth, Made by one God, Redeemed by one Jeſus, and Sanctified by one Holy Ghoſt: one would think theſe tyes enough to debar diviſion from among ſuch friends. <hi>Eſops</hi> bundle of Cudgels in the Fable are very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; whilſt they were all faſt bound up with a band, they were ſecure either from cracking or bending, but when once divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by one and one, eaſily ſnapt aſunder. Whilſt we are all under the bond of peace, we are ſecured by Gods protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98496:23"/>but when once divided, at the Devils mercy. Whilſt we hold together, we need not fear treating an enemy in the Gate, but when once broke aſunder with diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, a prey to them that hate us. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>Joah</hi> and <hi>Abiſhai's</hi> united ſtrengh, put the <hi>Syrians</hi> and <hi>Ammonites</hi> to flight; conſider that ye have enemies enow abroad, ye need not ſeek any ſo near home. Make not thoſe the objects of your malice that ſhould be the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks of your defence againſt the impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtorms and batteries of an inſnaring world, a bewitching fleſh, and an envious Devil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Know that there's unity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt wicked men (for they hold toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the Righteous.) <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> are Brethren in evil, and ſhall we be at odds? Nothing can be done well that's not done in unity; that's not well done (that's done through diſcenſion.) The Apoſtle tells us, That love is the fulfilling of the Law; how then can the Law be fulfilled without love. Thoſe bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells who wellcomed the new Born Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour into the world with a Song, did in a ſhort ſentence expreſs both Tables.

You know what our Saviour ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>By this ſhall men know ye</hi> have an intereſt in me, <hi>if ye love one another.</hi> If ever therefore ye expect to end in peace, or have peace in the end, be peaceable in your Pilgrimage, ſo ſhall ye in good time arive at your journeyes end, and be no longer ſtrangers abroad, but Kings at home.</p>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98496:24"/>then reign'd) vouchſafes to take upon him the title of Preacher; though the Preacher in theſe dayes muſt not think much of the worſt of titles, (but no more of that.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> having thus truly weighed all the pomps and greatneſs of this world in the balance of his underſtanding, and finding them too light to give ſatisfaction to the enjoyers thereof, in the end of this Book he gives a heavenly Exhortation, tending to the attainment of that true fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, as will make thoſe eternally happy that reach it. <hi>Fear God and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, for this is the whole duty of man.</hi> And for our better direction to keep Gods Commandments, this laſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter is uſher'd in, with a moſt excellent, wholeſome, and ſeaſonable Exhortation; <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I proceed further, here muſt one Objection be remov'd. Some may perhaps queſtion the Preacher, why he did not as well ſay, Remember thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in thy old age, as in the dayes of thy youth?</p>
               <p>I anſwer. This <hi>memento</hi> is chiefly given to young men, becauſe they take the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98496:25"/>greateſt liberty to wallow in all kinde of ſenſual pleaſures, and with the greateſt eagerneſs to purſue the deceiving vanities of this world; for now are their veins full of blood, and their bones full of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and Repentance ſeems as unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them as Snow in Summer, or Rain in Harveſt. Is not our youth (ſay they) given us to glut our ſelves with all kindes of pleaſures, and to walk in the wayes of our own hearts? Shall I then (ſayes one) grieve in my prime, and repent for my crimes to haſten old age, and make my ſmooth face full of wrinkles, and bring gray hairs on my head, ere I am an old man, old age will faſten on me ſoon enough without all this: let me therefore make hay while the ſun ſhines, and make the beſt uſe of my time I can, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt improvement of Pleaſures; and when I am growne ſo old as to be paſt uſing them, Ile caſt them off and think of repentance and another world, when 'tis not poſſible to ſtay long in this. Theſe are the Common Pleas of Youth, and therefore the Preacher looking upon them as the furtheſt from inſtruction, and to ſtand in the greateſt need of advice,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98496:25"/>directeth his ſpeech in a moſt eſpeciall manner to them, <hi>Remember now, &amp;c.</hi> Young men have no more a leaſe of their lives then aged perſons, and there doth as many of them go to the grave as of older perſons.</p>
               <p>Death arreſts ſome in their Cradles, and many in their Infancy, Childehood, and Youth. The dayes of man upon earth are but a ſhadow; no certainty of any thing as of Death, and nothing more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, then the time when, and the maner how. Come hither then thou darling of the world, thou great favorite of fleſh and blood; thou whoſe Honors (here) are as blooming as the Lillies and Roſes in thy youthful cheeks know Image, that though thy Head be of Gold, thy Body of Silver, thy Feet are but of Clay. If thou walk'ſt into the fields in the forward time of the Year, thou canſt not be unfurniſht of lively Emblemes of thy own Mortality: how do the Lilly, the Roſe, the Cowſlip, and the Gillyflower bemantle the earth, as ſo many ſtars to repreſent Heaven glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tapeſtry; upon ſight whereof you may eaſily be convinc't to believe, <hi>That Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in all his glory was not arayed like one of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98496:26"/>theſe:</hi> And yet how ſubject are they to fading; pluck them, and they are ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born; (ſoon crapt aſſunder) ſmell them, and they wither; and if the winde but blows over them, they are gone and be no more. And is it not ſo with thee? doth not St. <hi>James</hi> compare our life to a vapor, (and that's but ſhort.) <hi>David</hi> to a ſpan, a thought, a tale, (and thoſe not long.) <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to graſs, and the flower of the field, (and thoſe you ſee not laſting.) But of all the ſacred Limners in holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, I finde <hi>Jobs</hi> pencil to be the freeſt in pourtraying man: to ſtubble, and that not ſtanding neither; to a leaf, and that not faſt but ſhaken; and to a weavers ſhuttle, and many other ſuch tranſient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances.</p>
               <p>He came ſomething near the drawing man to the life, who compared this life to a ſpot between two Eternities; the time paſt being dead, the future unborn; and onely the narrow compaſs of the preſent, all that man can challenge. We know not how ſoon death may overtake us; when we are ſent into the world the greateſt part of our errand is to dye, and the onely buſineſs of our life to prepare
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98496:26"/>for death. We are not certain to be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of one minute of time; when we begin to breath, the next moment may be our laſt. How many have lien down to take a healthful ſleep that have wak't in another world: Death (ſaith a learned man) lies in wait for us in all places, and there's no eſcaping his tyranny. Death borders upon our Births, and our Cradles ſtand in our Graves. How many have we ſeen carried from the Womb to the Tomb, from the Birth to the Burial; and what a ſhort cut hath the longeſt liver from the Grave of the Womb to the Womb of the Grave. Ever ſince the fall of our firſt Father, death hath ranged through the world, and made a general ſlaughter of mankinde, (ſparing none.) The moſt eloquenteſt Orator that ever was, could never charm him; nor the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteſt Monarch that ever breathed, could never bribe him; the greateſt Warriour that ever was, death hath civilized; and made a green turf, or weather-beaten ſtone, cover that body, that living, a Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip could not cloathe, or the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: the moſt famous perſons that ever the world enjoyed, hath death laid at his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98496:27"/>feet, without regard either to Worth, Dignity, Majeſty, Youth, or Age, Sex or Condition; he favours not the beſt, nor ſpares the worſt. <hi>Samſon</hi> with all his ſtrength, <hi>Abſolon</hi> with all his beauty, <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> with all his zeal, <hi>David</hi> with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and <hi>Solomon</hi> with his glory; <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> with his wealth, and <hi>Irus</hi> with his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty; <hi>Lazarus</hi> with his boyles, and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi> with his bravery; the Beggar with his rags, and the Courtier with his robes; all come under the rugged imbraces of this grim Sergeant. He ſpared not Innocency it ſelf, but had the confidence to look the Son of the Higheſt in the face, arreſts him, and keeps him three dayes his priſoner in the Grave. The mortal Sythe is maſter of the Royal Scepter, and it mows down the Lillies of the crown, as well as the graſs of the field; death uſes no civillity to Princes more then Peſants; he findes them out in their Palaces, and it may be in their moſt retired Cloſets, and handles them no otherwiſe then the meaneſt perſon in the ſtreet. Death (ſaith a learned Divine) ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly ſnatcheth away Phyſicians, as it were, in ſcorn and contempt of Medicines, when they are applying their preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98496:27"/>and reſtoratives to others; as it is ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried of <hi>Caius Julius</hi> a Chyrurgeon, who dreſſing a ſore Eye, as he drew the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over it, was ſtruck by an Inſtrument of death in the act and place where he did it. Beſides diſeaſes, many by miſchances are taken, as a bird with a bolt, while he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth at the bow. Death is that King againſt whom there is no riſing up, which all men are ſure to meet with whatever they miſs of; but when, that's unknown. Of Dooms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day there are ſigns affirmative and nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, not ſo of death; every day we yield ſomething to him, our laſt day ſtands, the reſt run. And how ſhould this put us all in minde to prepare for death, that he ſnatcheth us not away at unawares. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou takeſt in hand therefore, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thine end,</hi> (ſaith the wiſe Man) <hi>and thou ſhalt never do amiſs.</hi> No thoughts ſo wholſome as thoſe of death, and none ſo profitable as thoſe of our end. We read of <hi>Iſaac</hi> that he brought his new Bride <hi>Rebecca</hi> into his Mother <hi>Sarahs</hi> Tent, thereby to moderate thoſe Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial pleaſures with the thoughts of her Memory, whoſe Corps but few dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were carried thence. And King <hi>Saul</hi> was no ſooner anointed, but <hi>Samuel</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:98496:28"/>ſends him by <hi>Rachels</hi> Sepulchre, leſt his new greatneſs of being a King might puff him up and make him to forget that he was a man. We read of many heathens who did ſo much contemplate on their mortality, as their diſcourſes, their houſes, and their tables, ſhould be conſtant Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors of it. The Aegyptians were wont to carry about their Tables a Deaths head at their greateſt feaſts; and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> on their Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation day, had a Maſon appointed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto them certain Marble-ſtones uſing theſe words (or to this purpoſe,)</p>

Young men remember this, you that may promiſe your ſelves many dayes upon earth, let not every day that is added to your life bring new ſins with it; but let grace be added to your dayes, that ſo your laſt dayes may be better then your firſt; and your burial day better then your birth, (as the wiſe Man ſpeaks.) Make God the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of all your actions, and remember him in your work, and he will remember you in the reward; remember him as an Omniſcient and Omnipotent God, one that beholds all thy actions, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them: remember him in thy youth, and let him have thy beſt dayes as well as thy worſt, the bloſſoms of thy Youth as well as the leaves of thy Old age; and be ſure that thou ſpend the glory of thy years, as well as the dregs of thy age, in his ſervice; ſo ſhall thy life be proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, thy death happy, and thy reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction glorious. On the contrary, if thou
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98496:29"/>forget him now, a day will come, when he will not remember thee, but ſtrangely excommunicate thee, with a <hi>depart from me, for I know you not:</hi> therefore ever bear this wholſome leſſon in minde and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it not, <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy Youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be ſome may think that Old Men come not within the verge of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, and that <hi>Solomon</hi> had nothing to ſay to them when he directed his ſpeech to the Young Man. I anſwer, that Old Men are more concerned to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this then the Young man, and thus I prove it. Young Men, are but newly come into the world, (and they muſt have ſome time to look about them. Old Men are ready to leave the World (and 'tis not long ere they muſt render an account to God for all their actions.) 'Tis but the dawning of the day with the Young Man, but night begins to ſhew it ſelf (in its ſable Robes) to the Old Man. The Young Mans Sun is but newly riſen, the Old Mans is ready to ſet; the Young Mans glaſs is but newly turned up, the Old Mans ſand is almoſt run out; the Young Man is but newly come from
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98496:29"/>the Grave of the Womb, the Old Man is ready to go to the Womb of the Grave. But it will be objected, that the Young Man often leaves the World as ſoon as come in it, onely begins to breathe, and ſo breathes his laſt; that many go away, as well at the dawning of the day as at the approaches of the night; and at Cocks crowing, as in the afternoon; and that the Young Mans Sun doth often ſet when but newly riſen; and his ſand run out, when his glaſs is but new turn'd up; and that the Womb oftentimes become his Tomb. I grant all this, that Young Men may dye (by caſualty or otherwiſe) as manifold examples before our eyes do hourly manifeſt. Young Men may dye, but Old men muſt dye, for nature is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extinguiſht in them, and in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability they cannot hold out long. What are thoſe gray Hairs but ſo many Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of their approaching Mortallity? What are the ſhrinking of the Veins, the coldneſs of the Blood the waſting of the Fleſh, the wrinkles in the Skin, the numneſs of the Joynts, the ſtiffneſs of the Limbs, the weakneſs of the Sinews, and the aches in the Bones, but ſo many har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bengers
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98496:30"/>of death, or friendly Memento's, to minde them of their Graves, and that thoſe dayes are now come, in which they may truly ſay, <hi>They have no pleaſure in them.</hi> And what a time is this for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when the tongue begins to faulter, deafneſs hath poſſeſt the ears, dimneſs vail'd the eyes, and the memory depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I confeſs 'tis good to call upon God at any time, (even on our death-beds) but 'tis better that we make our peace with God ere ſickneſs attache us. Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians obſerve that grief in time of ſickneſs is the greateſt enemy of health, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hinderer of Phyſick, and the greateſt haſtner of death. Indeed we ſhould be ever prepar'd for that ere it comes, that when we come to lie upon our ſick beds, there may be no diſcontent at it, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance in it; and nothing to be done, but to lie down and dye. Late repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is ſeldome good; I will not ſay ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver true: The example of the Thief up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs forbids me that, whom we know repented at the laſt hour; he was ſaved at the laſt minute, that none might deſpair; and but he, he had no fellow (though another dyed with him) tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>MY Contemplations are now fallen amongſt. <hi>Davids</hi> troubles, and this I am now to treat of not the leaſt; he was a man that went through many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and underwent many and great ſufferings; but neither time or the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row limits I am confin'd to, will give me leave to deſcant upon all his Troubles: I ſhall therefore onely glance at ſome, and ſpeak home to this (which may be term'd the greateſt.)</p>
               <p>But before I treat of the Troubles of this man, I ſhall ſpeak ſomething of this Man of Troubles; give a ſhort deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Man, then of his Sufferings.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:98496:31"/>
               <p>The firſt mention we have of <hi>Davids</hi> name is in the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.11. and there we finde him under a four-fold deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: who he is, what he was, whence he was, and when he liv'd.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for his Parentage or Pedegree, he was the ſon of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Obed,</hi> &amp;c. of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the youngeſt ſon of his Father.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for his Profeſſion a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, (as moſt of his Fathers were before him) but he ſoon relinquiſht that kinde of life; exchang'd his Crook for a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and his Sheep-fold for a Throne; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a publique Perſon, and grew ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, that all places ſounded with his Praiſes. That 'twere now but time loſt to ſtand playing with his name, or to uſe much diſcourſe upon it, for all that hear him mentioned, know that he was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and a King; and all other deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or definitions were altogether need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for his Countrey, he was of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> a City ſcituate in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, which was the moſt renowned of the World; and in the various diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gods Providence underwent ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98496:32"/>denominations. For (as an eminent Author judiciouſly obſerves) it was firſt called the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> from <hi>Canaan</hi> the ſon of <hi>Cham.</hi> Secondly, the Land of Promiſe, becauſe the Lord had promiſed it to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed. Thirdly, <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of the Iſraelites, (ſo called from <hi>Jacob</hi> who was ſurnamed <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Judea,</hi> from the Jews, or people of the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>Paleſtine (quaſi Philiſtim)</hi> the Land of the Philiſtims, (a potent Nation that once inhabited it.) And now ſixthly, <hi>The Holy Land,</hi> becauſe that herein was wrought the Work of our Redemption.</p>
               <p>Now whether the Regality of the tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> was ſo predominant as to give a Name to the whole Countrey, I determine not; but this is certain, that the little Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> (the place of <hi>Davids</hi> Nativity, and thence called the City of <hi>David</hi>) belonged unto, and was a part of that Portion or Inheritance denomited to that Tribe, when firſt this Countrey was conquer'd by the ſon of <hi>Nun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the time when he lived, it was in the dayes of King <hi>Saul,</hi> upon whoſe diſobedience, <hi>David</hi> is by Gods
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98496:32"/>appointment and approbation anointed King, (but not <hi>Sauls</hi> Competitor but Succeſſor.) <hi>David</hi> did long ſhroud him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf among the ſheep-cotes ere he came to the Kingdom; and for no ſhort time (in an ambitious eye) did he content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the garb of a ſhepherd (after he was anointed) ere he was known to be a King, or the ſon-in-law to one: but the rayes of his fame did ſhine from under the mean veil of a ſhepherd, that he could not be long concealed, but the world muſt be witneſs of his glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sauls</hi> Reign was very troubleſome, perpetual Wars betwixt him and the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines all his dayes; and this ſhall make way for <hi>Davids</hi> greatneſs. God many times keeps the beſt men for the worſt times, he loves to help at a dead lift; and therefore <hi>David</hi> ſhall act for him at ſuch a time, when <hi>Saul</hi> and all Iſrael are at their wits ends; then forth comes <hi>David</hi> (arm'd with the power of Jehovah) does wonders even to admiration; turns the Iſraelites Fears into Triumphs, and their Enemies Brags into Lachryma's.</p>
               <p>The manner, thus: The Philiſtines had invaded the Land, and put their Armies
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98496:33"/>in a poſture of Battle; and King <hi>Saul</hi> having alſo aſſembled the Iſraelites to give them the encounter, and ſet the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in array againſt the Philiſtines. And now both Armies facing each other on two neighbouring Mountains, the hoſt going forth, and giving a ſhout to the Battle, there iſſued from the Camp of the Philiſtines a Champion, (term him a man or a monſter) his name <hi>Goliah;</hi> the place of his nativity <hi>Gath;</hi> his ſtature ſix cubits and a ſpan; (which according to our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh meaſure is about three yards and a quarter.) His armor, a helmet of braſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his head, a coat of mail on his back, greaves of braſs upon his legs, and a tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get of braſs between his ſhoulders, a ſpear in his hand, the ſtaff to it like a weavers beam, (and one with a ſhield went before him.) His Language, a Challenge to any one of the Servants of <hi>Saul</hi> to fight with him: Concludes with a defiance to the hoſt of Iſrael, and to the Lord of hoſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> (being now ſent by his father <hi>Jeſſe</hi> from his ſheep in the wilderneſſe to his brethren in the camp, to enquire after their welfares, (for <hi>Jeſſe</hi>'s three eldeſt ſons attended King <hi>Saul</hi> to the Battle) obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98496:33"/>how <hi>Saul</hi> and all Iſrael were ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at his gaſtly countenance and daring language, and what great rewards were promiſed him that ſhould fight with him, as to have the Kings Daughter to wife, and his Fathers houſe free in Iſrael; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by this, and inſtigated by his impudent and blaſphemous expreſſions, reſolves to lay down the ſucceſs of that day on his encounter. And now both Armies full of expectation of the event of the combat, the Combatants draw near; little <hi>David</hi> only with his ſtone and ſling, and <hi>Goliah</hi> with his maſſie armour; and now <hi>Goliah</hi> belching forth his threats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>David,</hi> and deriſion againſt the Hebrews, <hi>David</hi> lets him know, that the God of Iſrael (whom he defied) was ſo powerful, as by ſo weak an inſtrument as himſelf, and ſo ſlenderly arm'd, could bring him and his brags to confuſion. <hi>David</hi> to make quick work pulls forth a ſtone, and that God who taught his hands to war and his fingers to fight, ſo directed his aim to the mark, that he hit him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the joynts of his armour, and down falls he to the earth with the Philiſtines victory. <hi>David</hi> takes his own ſword and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98496:34"/>decapits him, (attended with the accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Iſraelites) preſents it to <hi>Saul,</hi> who indeed makes good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to give him his Daughter, but he muſt undergo more hazards to obtain her, that no Iſraelite would undergo the danger, to purchaſe a Kings Daughter on ſuch dear terms; give for her dowry a hundred foreskins of the Philiſtines. But he that preſerved <hi>David</hi> from the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Bear, and from that uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Philiſtine, will ſtill crown him with victory to vanquiſh an hoſt; ſo that inſtead of one hundred he brings two, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.27. God was with <hi>David,</hi> and there's no talk of over coming thoſe whom he hath determined ſhall be victorious: no weapon that's form'd againſt him ſhall proſper; <hi>Saul</hi> with all his ſubtil projects to ſend him in haſte to another world, ſhall come too ſhort to inſnare him; for <hi>David</hi> ſhall be ſafe in the greateſt danger, and ſecure under the wings of an Enemy, (the Philiſtines) even in the Court of their King, and City of that monſter whom he had ſlain. No ſtone ſhall touch him at <hi>Ziklag,</hi> or arrow at <hi>Gilboa. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> Inſurrection ſhall come no nothing,

               <p>But here is one Objection ready to be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98496:38"/>thrown into my way, which I muſt not paſs by without anſwering. Doth God ſo ſeverely puniſh ſin, and he the authour of all? The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> asks the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Can there be evil in the city, and God hath not done it? Amos</hi> 3.6. And that word when 'tis put as an Interogatory in the beginning either of a Verſe or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, 'tis the higheſt affirmation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of a following Negative turth. Inſtance; Can a man take fire in his boſom and his clothes not be burnt? Can a man that is old return a ſecond time into his mothers womb, and be born again? Can we bring a clean thing out of an unclean; a pure Spring from a polluted Fountain? ſurely no. Can there be evil in the city, and God hath not done it? there cannot. And did God move <hi>David</hi> to commit the ſin of numbering the People, and doth he yet puniſh that ſin of <hi>Davids</hi> with the death of no leſs then ſeventy thouſand men? Is he ſo ſevere againſt that ſin of which himſelf is the authour?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, 'Tis the greateſt blaſphemy imaginable, to make God the Authour o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſin. <hi>Let not any man when he is tempted ſay, I am tempted of God, for God cannot b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:98496:38"/>tempted of evil; neither tempteth he any to evil, James</hi> 1.13. You are to know that there are two ſorts of evils, the evil of Sin, and the evil of Puniſhment; the one proper to God, the other incident to man. We read of ſeveral in Scripture that did evil in the ſight of the Lord, there is the evil of Sin: and then we read how God did inflict judgements upon them for thoſe ſins, there was the evil of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The guilt of the one requires the Juſtice of the other.</p>
               <p>Again, God is ſaid to be the Authour of ſin, becauſe he ſwayes all the actions of men; and were he pleaſed, he could take off the ſinner in the heat and height of his ſin; and with a word (as he made the World of nothing) bring all that is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to nothing: no ſin can be committed, or cruelty acted, without his permiſſion. And here by the way you are to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a great Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> That God permits many things to be done, which he doth not approve of when they are done; and to make this plain to the meaneſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, I could heap multitudes of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to confirm it. I am not ignorant that many have meaſured the juſtneſs of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98496:39"/>a Cauſe by the ſucceſs of it; and becauſe God (for the ſins of a Nation, or other reaſons beſt known to his Divine wiſdom) oftentimes ſuffer the beſt Cauſe to come by the worſt on't; therefore they of the Triumphing party have concluded, that God did own and approve both of them and their Cauſe in giving them the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But the greatneſs of their miſtake in ſo doing I ſhall manifeſt; in order to which I could produce manifold examples, and ſhew them that Vertue is ſometimes a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer and Vice triumphant; Gods people Captives, and his Enemies Conquerors. <hi>Salmanazar</hi> a heathen King drives the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites (God own people) ten Tribes at once, out of their own Land, into an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting captivity. And <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> an inſulting and profane Prince, makes havock in the holy Land, carries two Tribes into a ſeventy years captivity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits barbarous outrages, profanes the Temple, burns Jeruſalem to the ground, and deſtroyes all before him with fire and ſword. If Succeſs therefore be an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a good Cauſe, the Turk were the beſt Saint, the uncircumciſed Philiſtine the trueſt ſon of <hi>Abraham:</hi> of all things I
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98496:39"/>would never be a Chriſtian, for they of all men were moſt miſerable.</p>
               <p>For a concluſion to this point, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances I ſhall onely make choice of two; the one out of the Old Teſtament, the other out of the New. My firſt is that of the King of <hi>Aſſyria, Iſa.</hi> 10.6. whom God calls the rod of his anger, and gives a permiſſion and a commiſſion to tread down the Iſraelites as the mire in the ſtreets: and this proud domineering Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant inſults and triumphs, and intends the utter deſtruction of Gods people; was not his cauſe the beſt, that made him ſo victorious; but you ſhall finde other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for when God had ſufficiently ſcourged his people with this Rod, God had an end in it more then he dreamt of; for whereas he lookt not at all upon the hand of God in it, and thought of nothing but deſtruction, God made the end to conduce to the good of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and burnt this Rod in the fire, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.12.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, That of the Saviour of the World, who when he was brought to anſwer for his life before the Roman Preſident, and many things objected
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98496:40"/>againſt him by the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Pilate</hi> asks him many things, but he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers nothing; <hi>Pilate</hi> much offended hereat, argues the caſe with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in this manner, Knoweſt thou not the Eminency of my Perſon, the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my Place, and the largeneſs of my Power, that I can crucifie, or I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe thee; but our Saviour tells him, that that Power which he call'd his, was not his own; <hi>For thou hadſt no power over me, were it not given thee from above, John</hi> 19.10. I am ſo far from being under thy power, that I can lay down my life, and I can take it up; and did not I give thee a being, that am now a Priſoner at the Bar, thou couldſt never ſit upon me as a Judge on the Bench. The Scribes and Phariſees were ſo ſottiſhly ignorant, as to think that if Chriſt had been the Son of God, (as he ſaid he was) they ſhould never have been ſuffered to have ſent him with ſo much cruelty to his Grave; and becauſe they had their wills of him, they did therefore believe that God approved of that bloody fact of theirs, and plainly demonſtrated that he was a deceiver: theſe were their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98496:40"/>concluſions concerning him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.63. <hi>Pilate</hi> and the Jews were but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary cauſes of his death, they were but inſtruments in another hand; for 'twas God that did deliver his Son to be crucified; he was that Lamb ſlain (in Gods decree) before the foundations of the world were laid. And 'tis alſo true, that Chriſt delivered himſelf to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his chearful obedience to the Will of his Father: yet this did in no way clear <hi>Judas</hi> that betrayed him, the Scribes and Phariſees that blaſphem'd him, <hi>Pilate</hi> that condemn'd him, the Souldiers that abus'd him, nor the Jews that crucified him, becauſe of their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent aims and ends in it; for he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by <hi>Judas</hi> for money, by the Jews for envy, by <hi>Pilate</hi> for fear, by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in wickedneſs, and by God in love. Their deſign in crucifying Chriſt, was to hinder the Salvation of Mankind, but God perfected Mans Salvation by their deſigns. And that God did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of that ſin of theirs (though he permitted it) appears by thoſe ſevere and remarkable judgements inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the actors thereof. And firſt of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:98496:41"/>who was foremoſt in the Treaſon, he alſo is the firſt in Puniſhment; he brings his wages of iniquity back to the chief Prieſts, and hang'd himſelf, and ſo his Puniſhment is no leſs publique then his Sin. And for <hi>Pilate</hi> (if eminent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors may be credited) he was by the Emperour <hi>Tiberias</hi> baniſhed into <hi>France,</hi> and dyed miſerably. And as for the Scribes, Phariſees, Souldiers, and the whole Rout of Jews, <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, that thoſe that were left of them, were forty yeares after, all ſwept away by Famine, Sword, and Peſtilence; and the lofty City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Temple therein, burnt to aſhes, by <hi>Titus</hi> ſon of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> Emperour of <hi>Rome.</hi> And 'tis moſt certain, that the guilt of Chriſts blood lies ſo heavy on the heads of the Poſterity of thoſe Jews, that they are now a vagabond Nation, ſcattered over the face of the Earth; hated of all, eſteemed of none, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hardneſs of heart unto this day. God is of purer eyes then to behold the leaſt ſin with approbation; all manner of impieties his ſoul abhors, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he render the Authors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98496:41"/>odious, and makes their Names ſtink to Poſterity. Inſtance <hi>Cain,</hi> for that ſin of his in killing his Brother, hath the mark of a Rogue clapt upon his Name, which poſterity ſhall never take off, <hi>A fugative and a vagabond ſhalt thou be in the earth, Gen.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> for that ſin of theirs, in ſlaying the Seche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, under pretence of circumciſing them; their Names are never mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without the infamous addition, <hi>of brethren in iniquity, Gen.</hi> 49.5. <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> for ſetting up Calves in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> under pretence of ſaving the Jews a labour of going up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, his Name is never mentioned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an infamous brand, never to be wip't off, <hi>Jeroboam that made Iſrael to ſin,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Ahaz,</hi> for thoſe many and grievous ſins by him commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, hath a Name by himſelf, that he might be known to be the worſt King that ever reigned either in <hi>Iſrael</hi> or <hi>Judah, This is that King Ahaz!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the prophane and idolatrous King, that cut in pieces the veſſels of the Lords Houſe, abuſed the Prieſts of the Lord, ſhut up the doors of the Temple,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98496:42"/>made Altars in every corner in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> advanced the high places, put down the worſhip of God, and put up that of Devils; and in the time of his diſtreſs, did treſpaſs yet more againſt the Lord, <hi>This is that King Ahaz,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.22. <hi>Judas</hi> for that ſin of his, in betraying the Saviour of the World, his Name is not any where mentioned, but there is an ignominious blur put upon it, for poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to read, <hi>Judas Iſcariot,</hi> who alſo was the Traytor, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.4.</p>
               <p>And God is ſo juſt that he will not act that himſelf, for which he ſo ſeverely puniſhes others for being guilty of.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, did God move <hi>David</hi> to number the people? and doth he yet puniſh that ſin of <hi>Davids</hi> with the death of no leſs then ſeventy thouſand Men? Is he ſo ſevere in puniſhing that ſin of which himſelf is the Author? I anſwer, in the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.1. 'tis ſaid, <hi>That God moved David to number the people;</hi> and in the 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1. 'tis ſaid, <hi>That Satan tempted David to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the people:</hi> For the reconciling of theſe Scriptures you are to take notice, that God is ſaid to move <hi>David</hi> to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98496:42"/>number the people, becauſe he did for a little withdraw the Arms of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from him, left him to himſelf, and permitted Satan to tempt him (who fraught with malice enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>David</hi>) proves ſucceſsful in his attempts, and brings <hi>David</hi> to commit this ſin.</p>
               <p>And for further confirmation of this Truth, I ſhall borrow an Arrow out of a Learned Quiver, and demonſtrate the ſeveral kindes of Tempters, with the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious natures of their Temptations; God, Satan, Man, the World, and the Fleſh, are all ſaid to tempt. God temps Man to try his obedience. Satan temps Man to draw him from obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Men tempt men to try what is in them; and Men tempt God; by diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Power. The World is a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, to keep Man from God, and the Fleſh is a Tempter, to bring him to the Devill. So God tempted <hi>Abraham</hi> in the offering of his Son; Satan tempted <hi>Job</hi> in the loſs of his Goods; A Queen tempted <hi>Solomon</hi> in trying his wiſdom; The Iſraelites tempted God by unbelief in the Deſert; The World tempted
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98496:43"/>
                  <hi>Demas,</hi> when he forſook the Apoſtles and the fleſh tempted <hi>David</hi> when he fell by Adultery; and his own corruptions, together with the inſtigation and ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Satan, tempts him to commit this ſin, for which God was ſo highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with him, that he ſent ſuch a harſh ſummons to him, that inſtead of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he breaks out in the language of the Text, <hi>And David ſaid, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus have I fairly remov'd this great block out of the way at which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have ſtumbled, and many more might have fallen; what now remains, but that I onely in brief ſet down the ſad effects of ſin in general to all mankinde, and ſo Ile conclude.</p>
               <p>But by the way, I muſt crave leave of my Readers to make a ſhort digreſſion, briefly to ſhew how glorious man was by Creation, how happy in his ſtate of Innocency, how great his fall, and how miſerable the effects of it, and that ſhall be my concluſion.</p>
               <p>Man was created a glorious Creature, and heir to much happineſs; put in a ſtate of innocency, ſeated in an earthly Paradiſe, and placed as a Monarch over all
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98496:43"/>the Creatures that God made (except thoſe bleſſed Angels that are reſident in a higher Sphere) the Beaſts of the Field, and the Fowls of the Air, the Fiſh in the Sea, and all Creeping things did him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and he gave them their Names; The place of his Reſidence, the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> (a fit Emblem of that Celeſtial Paradiſe that is above) there being all the varieties that heart could wiſh or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to make a life happy, without either carking or caring, moiling or toiling, ſighing or ſorrowing; and to make his happineſs compleat, he was to continue without the limits of Threeſcore Years and Ten, or Fourſcore Years; his Body no leſs immortal then his Soul: Here was a happy life indeed, where there was no Sicknes to torment, no Death to affright, or Devil able to hurt. And as a further addition to his Happineſs, (that nothing might be wanting that may any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to his well being) a beloved compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is given him (with ſuch a body and ſuch a ſoul as he had) for his perpetual conſort, to keep him from the dumps of melancholly, and be a conſtant ſharer with him in all his felicity. <hi>Adam</hi> thus
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98496:44"/>happy, the fruit of every tree in that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Eden (onely one excepted) was for his uſe; and to eat of that one tree, was death to himſelf and poſterity. This tree ſtood in the midſt of the Garden, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as a touchſtone to try their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The Devil (not long before thrown from Heaven for his pride) perplext not more at his own miſery then mans hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; envying that Man (a creature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to him by creation) ſhould uſurp his place, to fill up that room, or ſhine in that Orb whence himſelf was caſt; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to work his wits to bring Man as miſerable as himſelf; and thus he mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the deſign: he gets into the Serpent, ſo climbs the tree, waits his opportunity, and ſets upon the Woman; tells her the tree is handſome, the fruit beautiful and the taſte much more delightful; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her not ſo tractable as he deſired, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beſpeaks her thus: Fear not the threats or menaces of thy Creator, for no evil ſhall acrue to thee or thine, by eating the lovely fruit of this fair tree. Do not make me believe a thing I know to be falſe; tell not me of dying the death, 'tis no ſuch matter; for when you
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98496:44"/>have once taſted, you ſhall be no longer ſervants of him that made you, but Lords and Maſters of your ſelves; and every way as great and as good as he that made you. Were not trees made for fruit, and what was fruit made for but to eat; then why not this, as well as others? And thus by the alluring ſpeeches of this ſubtil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, the Woman is deluded, <hi>Adam</hi> perverted, the moſt high God highly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonoured, and all mankinde without an infinite mercy ruined; ſhe taſtes, and gives her husband with her, and he did eat. And ſo man that was ſo fearfully and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made, and in ſo happy and glorious condition, hath forfeited all by this one act of diſobedience, is become a Map of perfect miſery; (ſo that as one wittily obſerves) man is ſhut out, of the doors of his everlaſting habitation for two pretty toyes, an Apple and a Woman. And now the judgements of God like a troop purſue him and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; and all the miſeries and calamities of this life and that to come, follow cloſe at his heels, as the effect and reward of ſin and brings him to ſuch <hi>a Non-plus</hi> (being loaded with ſo much gilt, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98496:45"/>with ſo many judgements, and therefore no wonder to ſee him caſt down and dejected. <hi>Wherefore doth a living man mourn,</hi> or <hi>complain,</hi> was a Prophets que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion? and 'tis ſadly anſwered by himſelf, <hi>A man for the puniſhment of his ſin,</hi> Lam. 3.39. <hi>I have ſinned, and what ſhall I ſay unto thee, O thou preſerver of men,</hi> ſayes <hi>Job. Wo unto us, for we have ſinned,</hi> cryes the Church, Lament. 5.16. <hi>David</hi> cryes, <hi>That his ſins were gone over his head, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a burthen too heavy for him to bear;</hi> and therefore after his committing this ſin, no wonder if he were ſo amaz'd at the propoſal of thoſe terrors for it, that he breaks out into the diſcontented expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Text; <hi>And David ſaid unto Gad, I am in a great ſtrait.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had it not been for Sin, Death had never fetcht his circuits through the world. Neither <hi>Adam</hi> or any of his ſons, had never come under his power. 'Twas Sin that brought in thoſe terrible Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bengers of Death; thoſe various kindes of ſickneſſes to afflict mankinde. For as the ſhadow follows the body, ſo plagues attend Sin: and had the cauſe been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (which is Sin) the effects had never
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98496:45"/>been (which is Miſery.) There had been no ſweeping away of mankinde by Sword or Famine. Famine ſhould never have conquered his thouſands, or the Sword his ten thouſands. There ſhould have been no waſting Conſumption, no grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Gout, nor groaning Stone, or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Collick; no burning Feaver, or quaking Ague, nor trembling Palſie, or loathſome Jaundies; nor a thouſand other Infirmities and Caſualties which now attend frail man to his Grave. But this is not all, for Death eternal alſo is the reward of Sin, which is the ſecond Death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.14. and may well be term'd a death and no death; being a privation from all that's good, or to a life deſirable, and a conſtancy in ſuffering that which is evil, even intollerable torments that ſhall never know either end or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, impoſſible for life to ſuffer, did not an infinite Juſtice keep the tortured from dying; for there the beſt company ſhall be Devils, and the beſt muſick Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The ear ſhall be entertained with the grievous ſcreeches of parties condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and hideous howlings of woful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; the eye, with no better proſpect

               <p>THeſe words were utter'd by <hi>Balaam</hi> the ſon of <hi>Beor</hi> of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> the notedſt Conjuror of thoſe times, whom <hi>Balak</hi> King of <hi>Moab</hi> ſent for to curſe Iſrael; and being come for that purpoſe from the Mountains of the Eaſt to the high places of <hi>Baal,</hi> beholds a glimpſe of Heavens Glory and Iſraels happineſs; diſcovers better wages then <hi>Balak</hi> could give him, greater prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then <hi>Balak</hi> could exalt him to, and infinitely more honour then was at <hi>Balaks</hi> diſpoſal. <hi>Balaam</hi> being in an
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98496:49"/>extaſie, and (as it were) raviſht with the glory which he ſees, turns his propheſie into a prayer, and his prayer is this: <hi>Let me dye the death of the righteous, and let my latter end be like his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Were theſe the words of a Sorcerer, a better mouth might have ſpoke it? we may well admire that ſo ſweet a ſaying ſhould proceed from ſo foul a mouth; that ſuch a flower of Paradiſe ſhould grow on ſuch a Dunghil; that a ſtranger and an enemy to the God of Iſrael and the People of Iſrael, ſhould ſo excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth the glory of the one, and the happineſs of the other; and that he ſhould have ſo much of heaven in ſo ſhort a prayer, <hi>Let me dye,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>'Twas our Saviours queſtion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.16. <hi>Do men gather Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thiſtles.</hi> Here's a Thorn brings forth Grapes, an Inchanter with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of a Prophet. How can we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiciently admire the wiſdome and power of God, in making wicked men to ſound forth his praiſes, even the Devil himſelf to ſet forth the glory of the Father, and proclaim the divinity of the Son. Hard hearted <hi>Pharaoh</hi> muſt confeſs his power,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98496:49"/>the Magicians his works; and <hi>Balaam</hi> ſhall be ſenſible of his glory, witneſs his Petition, <hi>Let me dye,</hi> &amp;c. A foul breath may make a Trumpet ſound ſweetly, a crackt Bell may toll in others to Church, a ſtinking carcaſe may have a honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb in it; and a Sorcerer may ſpeak good Divinity: I am ſure <hi>Balaam</hi> did, and a prayer as excellent, <hi>Let me dye the death of the righteous, and let my latter end be like his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence obſerve, that we are not to judge of any man by his words or paſs our verdict by the out-ſide; for many cry <hi>Templum Domini</hi> with their mouths, that have the Devil in their hearts; and the Devil himſelf ſometimes counterfeits an Angel of light. Many make a fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity, that ſpeak well, hear much, and underſtand more; upon examination you will finde by their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they have meerly a <hi>form of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, but deny the power of it;</hi> that at beſt will appear but like the Devil in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels</hi> Mantle. We uſe to ſay, that all is not gold that gliſters, and 'tis as true that all are not holy that ſeem ſo; all not Saints that have demure looks and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98496:50"/>pretences. Our Saviour hath told us, that the tree is known by his fruit; and God that ſearches the reins, knows the heart, and judges of the outward actions by it. <hi>Balaams</hi> words beſpeak him both a Prophet and a Saint; and he did as clearly propheſie of Chriſt, as any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of the Lord, either before or after him: and 'tis thought by ſome, that his Prophecy of a Star to riſe out of <hi>Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. drew thoſe Perſians King to attend the motion of that Star that appeared at our Saviours Incarnation. 'Tis moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that <hi>Balaam</hi> ſpake ſo well, that no man could ſpeak better; yet he could ſpeak ſo bad, that the Devil himſelf could not ſpeak worſe; as when he adviſed the Moabites to ſend their Daughters to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit whoredom with the Iſraelites, which occaſioned the death of twenty four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Hebrews. And ſo I paſs from the Speakers deſcription, to the deſcription of his Speech.</p>
               <p>The ſpeaker was <hi>Balaam,</hi> and his ſpeech, or rather his prayer, was, <hi>Let me dye the death of the righteous, and let my latter end be like his. Balaam</hi> is ſo taken with the rayes of that Glory he beholds
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98496:50"/>at a diſtance, that he grows impatient. No more of life, nothing in it ſo deſirable. No more of this world, he ſees more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the next, and therefore courts death to convey him to that glory which he ſo much longs for. <hi>Let me dye, &amp;c.</hi> What, could he not dye without asking leave? without much intreaty, death was ready to attend him; and for want of help he might have been his own executioner, and (as King <hi>Saul</hi> did a long time after) made his own ſword to have given him his <hi>Mittimus</hi> to the grave. No, <hi>Balaam</hi> (as bad as he was) would not lay violent hands on himſelf; he knew that God would not entertain any runnagate or ſtraggling ſons that came without his call. That God who infus'd a living Soul into our Bodies (when we began to be) will not have that ſoul come forth till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it. 'Tis written <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.21. <hi>To him that overcomes, will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne; even as I alſo overcame, and am ſet down with my Father in his Throne.</hi> To him that overcomes, not to him that runs away: to him that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers, not him that flies from his colours. We are now but on our way, not yet in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98496:51"/>our countrey. In this world we muſt do our work, in that to come we muſt have our wages. Here we muſt fight under the Banner, there we muſt receive (if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it) the Crown. This world is a Sea of trouble, that a Haven of reſt; and thoſe who to avoid the troubles of this, ruſh themſelves out, by laying violent hands on themſelves, ſhall never reach the happineſs of that. For how can God afford Mercy to thoſe, who have none for themſelves? <hi>Balaam</hi> would dye, but how? There are (ſaith one) three ſorts of death; the death of Nature, the death of Sin, and the death of Grace, (or rather a gracious death) or the death of the Juſt. 'Tis onely the laſt that <hi>Balaam</hi> ſues for: <hi>Let me dye</hi> (ſayes he) but no death will ſerve his turn, but that of the Juſt; <hi>Let me dye the death of the righteous, and let my latter end be like his.</hi> My latter end, he is not altogether for himſelf, he hath ſome care of his poſterity after him; he knew that God would be <hi>Abrahams ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great reward;</hi> and that he would be the ſame to his ſeed that he was to him: be the God of his ſeed, and of his ſeeds ſeed; and in them ſhould all the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98496:51"/>Nations of the world be bleſſed. So <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> prayes in reſpect of his own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular end, and for his poſterity, thoſe that were come, or were to come out of his loins, <hi>Let my latter end be like his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the further amplifying of this Prayer of <hi>Balaams,</hi> I ſhall draw theſe following Concluſions from it:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, That the Righteous dye, &amp;c.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, That their death is happy, and attended with glory.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, That none ſhall dye ſo, but thoſe that live ſo; or, that a holy Life is the onely prologue to a happy Death.</item>
                  <item>Laſtly, I ſhall preſent you with ſome ſhort Directions, how to lead ſuch a life, how to reach ſuch a Death, and this ſhall be my concluſion.</item>
               </list>
               <p>That Death is a debt of Nature, to be paid by all the ſons of men, is ſo known a truth, that it needs no further proof then common experience; the decree hath long ſince gone forth, that all men muſt once dye. So ſure as death (ſayes our common Proverb) and that's ſo ſure, that nothing more certain. For of all the Priviledges that Chriſt purchaſt for the ſons of men, he never granted this; for he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98496:52"/>himſelf taſted of death, and ſo muſt all thoſe do that breathe upon this earth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe onely that ſhall be found alive at the day of judgement, which ſhall not dye but be chang'd. None are exempted from deaths rage, no honey without this gall, no exaltation without this humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; all muſt paſs through his black Gates ere they can enter into glory.</p>
               <p>And this brings me from the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to the ſecond; from the certainty of death to all mankinde, to the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it to the righteous. <hi>Let my latter end be like his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot blame <hi>Lalaam</hi> for making ſuch wiſhes, and it had been well for him if it had fallen ſo, he had then been eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy as now miſerable. Indeed, death to a righteous man, is but a ſleep, (for ſo our Saviour ſtiles it;) it puts an end to our miſeries and a beginning to our joyes; it cures all diſeaſes, the aking head and the fainting heart, <hi>Aſa</hi> of his Gout, and <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> of his lameneſs, <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> of his Sores, and <hi>Gehazi</hi> of his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie; finiſhes that life that was a kinde of death (or a paſſage to it,) and gives birth to another, not ſubject to mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98496:52"/>and ſerves as a ſhort bridge to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the Pious ſoul to a ſpacious inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>But it may here come within the verge of an inquiry, whether the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous may deſire death; 'tis anſwer'd that it may de deſired, not for it ſelf, but for what it brings.</p>
               <p>Firſt we may deſire it, as it puts a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to ſin: there's no offending of God in the Grave, ſin will be an inmate with the choiceſt of Gods Saints whilſt they are here, but is forc't to leave them when they leave the world. For (as one obſerves) ſin was the Midwife (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the womb) that brought death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and death muſt be the Grave to bury ſin (ſo the Mother is kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Daughter.) Again, we may deſire it, as it brings us home to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, near our Head and our el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother, ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> deſir'd it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 5.23.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That none ſhall dye ſo, but thoſe that live ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For as the effect follows the cauſe, or the ſhadow the body; ſo happineſs is the attendant of holineſs. Would <hi>Balaam</hi> dye the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98496:53"/>death of the Righteous, that was ſo far (as a learned Author obſerves of him) from living the life of the Righteous, that he gave Peſtilent counſel againſt the lives of Gods Iſrael: and though here in a fit of compunction, he ſeem a friend, yet he was after ſlain by the Sword of Iſrael, whoſe happineſs he admires and deſires to ſhare in. Carnal men care not to ſeek that which they would gladly finde; ſome faint deſires and ſhort-winded wiſhes may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found in them, but their miſtake is in breaking Gods chain, to ſunder Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs from Happineſs, Salvation from Sanctification, the end from the means; they would dance with the Devil, and ſup with Chriſt at night. Live all their lives long in <hi>Dalilahs</hi> lap, and then go to <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom when they dye. The Romaniſts have a ſaying, that a man would deſire to live in <hi>Italy</hi> (a place of great pleaſure) but to dye in <hi>Spain;</hi> becauſe there the Catholick Religion (as they call it) is ſo ſincerely profeſt. And a Heathen being askt whether he would rather be <hi>Socrates,</hi> a painful Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, or <hi>Craeſus</hi> a wealthy King;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98496:53"/>anſwer'd, That for his life he would be <hi>Craeſus,</hi> but for the life to come, <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates.</hi> But ſtay, not here and hereafter too; you know what Father <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to <hi>Dives</hi> in flames; <hi>Son, Remember that thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things,</hi> and therefore now, muſt look for evil. That King <hi>Balaks</hi> proffers, were ſo liberal, that <hi>Balaam</hi> was loath to forgo ſo fat a Morſel, his mouth watred, and his fingers itcht to be dealing with <hi>Balak;</hi> (he will ask God again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to gain ſuch a prize) and his heart again is raviſht with Iſraels happineſs: he would fain pleaſe <hi>Balak,</hi> if he might not diſpleaſe God in it, and partake of both; but as <hi>Balak</hi> had not his will, ſo neither had <hi>Balaam</hi> either his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or his wiſh. God oftentimes fools wicked men of their expectations, that whilſt they ſtrive to gain the happineſs of both worlds at once, finde neither: ſo here, I know not how fitter to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Balaam</hi> then to a ſtranger travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a far Countrey, beholds the ſtate and magnificence of the Court, but no intereſt in the King; or to a ſurveyor of Lands, that takes an exact compaſs
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98496:54"/>of other mens Grounds, of which he ſhall never enjoy a foot.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſee him (ſayes <hi>Balaam</hi>) ſo ſhall every eye, and thoſe alſo that pierc't him; but not as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw him and rejoyced; nor as <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 19.25. The pure in heart onely ſee him to their comfort; when <hi>Balaam</hi> beholds him it ſhall be with terror; and though when he made this prayer his ſoul danc't on his lips, ready to flye off, yet was he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver nearer heaven then thoſe <hi>Piſgah</hi> Hills; Had <hi>Balaams</hi> works been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to his words, or his worth to his wiſhes, he might have reacht his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. But as <hi>Saul</hi> who was once among the Prophets fell after from God, ſo <hi>Balaam</hi> is not long in theſe raptures, and therefore for all his devotion, though he were not ſo wicked as to kill himſelf, is nevertheleſs ſo unfortunate, as to fall by the Sword of the Iſraelites, even among the thickeſt of Gods Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the Midianites; as you may read at large in the one and thirtieth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Book of <hi>Numbers,</hi> v. 8.</p>
               <p>There is no man ſo much an enemy to himſelf, but would be happy if happineſs
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98496:54"/>were to be gain'd with wiſhing for. Ask the wickedſt man upon earth, if he does not hope to dye well, he will tell you he does, and ſo he will, if a word upon his death-bed will do it; A <hi>Lord have mercy upon me:</hi> but alas Heaven is not to be attained on ſuch eaſie tearms. <hi>Cain</hi> may be diſtracted for his Murder, <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> may Propheſie, <hi>Ahab</hi> walk in Sack-cloth, <hi>Judas</hi> Preach and do miracles, and all to no purpoſe; 'twas not <hi>Eſau's</hi> blubber'd eyes that could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover either his Birth-right or his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bleſſing. I cannot but reprehend their folly that ſpend their dayes in ſin and vanity, and at the point of death, think to turn ſuddain penitents, as if that would do: how foully are they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken that think ſo, for he that lives like a devil upon earth, (though under an Angels vail) ſhall never be a Saint in Heaven?</p>
               <p>So I have now done with the parts propos'd: what remains, but that I in brief give ſome ſhort directions, how to lead this happy life, how to reach that happy death, and ſo Ile conclude. For the certain and ſpeedy attainment of which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98496:55"/>be pleaſed ſeriouſly to weigh theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing inſtructions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, be converſant in the Scriptures, make that your day and your night ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and take notice of the lives of all Gods Saints, and endeavours to track them in thoſe ſteps which brought them to glory. Make <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, and <hi>Jobs</hi> patience <hi>Eliahs</hi> zeal, and <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> Integrity, patterns of your immitation. Let <hi>Joſeph</hi> be an example of uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd chaſtity, and <hi>Moſes</hi> of meekneſs and humility. Let <hi>Davids</hi> troubles teach us to depend upon Gods Providence, and <hi>Pauls</hi> perſeverance, not to be weary of his Corrections. Remember the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter which our Bleſſed Saviour gave of the Baptiſt, <hi>That he was a burning and a ſhining light.</hi> Indeed the Saints of God in all ages have ſerv'd as Beacons on hills to give light to a crooked and perverſe generation. Oh that we could but learn by their examples to adorn our profeſſion, and we ſhall be no lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers in the end. What ſayes <hi>David, Marke the upright man, and behold the juſt,</hi> (indeed he is worth the noting) <hi>for the end of that man is peace.</hi> He it is that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98496:55"/>may be truly ſaid to leave this world like a Lamb, and ſhall for ever be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a better for one of Chriſts fold. But above all look upon him that is the Author and finiſher of your Faith; ſtrive to immitate the bleſſed ſteps of the holy Jeſus, whoſe feet were ever running Gods Commandements, whoſe hands were ever buſied in works of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, his eyes ever looking for Objects of Mercy, whoſe Soul was ever yerning with bowels of Compaſſion, whoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was alwayes gracious, and guile never found in his lips. And that we may be the better fitted to write after ſuch bleſſed copies, let us ſet a narrow watch over our thoughts, words, and actions, that we offend in neither; but remember that he is an Almighty and Omniſcient God, with whom we have to do, and all things naked and bare to his all-ſeeing eye; and that we may make a happy progreſs in our Chriſtian courſe, let's trample on the vanities of this world and have our converſation in Heaven whilſt we are on Earth. Put a right value on the things of this world, and whilſt we are in this; make ſure of a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98496:56"/>better, that when this fabrick ſhall be on a flame, we may finde a place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in thoſe glorious and everlaſting Habitations: and that we by no means put off our Repentance from day to day, but take time by the fore-top, for we know not what a day may bring forth. There are many now in Hell yelling forth their too late Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that would have repented, had they had a morrow; let us be ever contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating of our laſt end, and of that great account we muſt all one day make, and account every day as our laſt; that when death comes we may be ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for his approach, as to entertain him as a friend, not dread him as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. 'Twas a good prayer of <hi>Davids, Pſal.</hi> 9.20. <hi>Let the Nations know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be but men.</hi> Oh that we did but ſeriouſly take this into our conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and rightly underſtand our frame whereof we are made, and remember that we are but duſt; and what is duſt but the ſlave of the beeſom and the ſport of the winde.

               <p>Firſt, then for the object or perſon here ſpoken of, who it is, who is this that comes ſayes <hi>Iſay?</hi> 'Tis he that was from eternity, before the Mountains were brought forth, or the foundations of the world were laid, God from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting and world without end.

In a word, he was the Light of the Gentiles, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to them he manifeſted himſelf by a ſtar, (or rather by an Angel, (as ſome think in a Pillar of fire) and the glory of his people Iſrael, (becauſe to them he was proclaime'd by Angels.) Thus you have now ſeen who it is that is here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, I now come to the act that he is here ſaid to do.</p>
               <p>He came, he bow'd the heavens and came down, exchanged his Fathers Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for the Virgins womb, and became <hi>Immanuel, God with us. The expreſs Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of his Father</hi> takes the form of a Servant.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98496:58"/>Condeſcentions of our Bleſſed Saviour, that he that was ſo great that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens could not contain him, ſhould be ſo little as to be circumſcrib'd in the Womb of a Virgin. That he that was ſo rich that all the Gold and the Silver was his, and the Cattel upon a thouſand hills, ſhould be ſo poor as to be deſtitute of a penny to pay <hi>Caeſar</hi> tribute, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beholding to a fiſhes mouth. That he that was ſo powerful as to command the Devils to their Chains, ſhould be ſo meek as to ſuffer himſelf to be led like a Lamb to the ſlaughter. Yet thus he ſuffer'd it to be <hi>to fulfill all Righteouſneſs;</hi> and nothing did he think too much either to do or ſuffer for mans Redemption.</p>
               <p>Man had finn'd againſt an infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; and ſatisfaction was to be made to an offended Deity; and that ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be as infinite as the nature of the tranſgreſſion was, which ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction could be given no other way but by ſuffering; that ſuffering no leſs then the utmoſt of an inraged and incenſed malice; that malice as general as men and devils; the puniſhment great, the puniſhers many; Heaven, Earth, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98496:58"/>Hell (an angry God, an incenſt World, and an inraged Hell) and he that was to indure all this to be innocent. No man ſo pure, no angel ſo powerful to undergo all this, God could not dye, nor men or Angels bear ſuch a burden, therefore it muſt be a God-man, (a God and Man united in one Perſon, the one to bear, the other to ſuffer; and ſuch a one was our Bleſſed Saviour whoſe ſpotleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and unconquered Patience in in his expreſleſs pains, repreſents the refulgent Rayes of a Divine Power that kept frail Humanity from ſinking to deſperation under ſo great a preſſure; all muſt needs acknowledge that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries he indured were unſpeakable, and his patience infinitely beyond a preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. If we take but a ſtrict ſurvey of the means and miſeries that attend his Birth, the inexpreſſable grievances of his life, and the ſadneſs of his death, we ſhall in each of theſe finde him demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated a man of Sufferings.</p>
               <p>He was born in little obſcure <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> not in great and glorious <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and not in a Palace there, (though the City of <hi>David</hi>) but an Inne, (a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98496:59"/>place of common reſort.) Not in the gueſt Chamber, or choiceſt Room in the Inne, but in a Stable, a place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for Beaſts, (far unfit for the King of kings Bed-chamber) the Lamb which all the ſhepherds left their flocks to finde, is laid in a Manger; his attendants but mean and not many, his reputed Father and the Bleſſed Virgin; no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er eight dayes old but the circumciſing knife (according to the Law) muſt paſs upon him (that came to fulfill both the Law and the Prophets) with the loſs of his Blood, (as an earneſt of that which after in a more abundant manner flowed from him.) And before two years old, is forc't to flye for his Life when he could not go; his whole Life 'twas but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſupply of Croſſes, from his <hi>Alpha</hi> in the Manger, to his <hi>Omega</hi> on Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> from his Cradle to his Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, and from his Womb to his Tomb, he might truly be termed a <hi>man of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.</hi> When once he ſhewed himſelf to the world, how was he hunted like a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge upon the Mountains, in often ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards of his Life ere his hour was come he ſhould lay it down. He had not his
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98496:59"/>mean Birth for nothing, for as he was born under another mans roof, ſo all the time of his Life had he no houſe of his own, (he that was Lord of all poſſeſt nothing.) He was poorer then the Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and not ſo rich as the Fowls of the Aire, (for the one had holes, the other had neſts) but he no place of his own to reſt in. (For a houſe he hath not a hole, for Lands he hath none, but what he treads upon; for moneys, a fiſh brings him a piece to pay his Tribute with; for pleaſure, the Croſs is his Cogniſance; for Honour, Contempt is his common Livery.) How much ignomy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt did he paſs through, and how many opprobrious words did he patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive from the foul-mouth'd Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, who were ever guilty of putting the worſt gloſſes and conſtructions on his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

If he heals a Crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or do any other work of mercy on the Sabbath day, he is preſently cenſur'd for a profaner of the Sabbath.

Here began the travel and anguiſh of his Soul, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't thoſe drops of bloody ſweat, which in ſo plentiful a manner flowed from him in a cold Winters night. The conflict muſt needs be ſharp that put him in ſuch a heat in ſo cool an Aire, as doubtleſs it was, for the ſins of the whole world lay upon him. 'Twas thy ſin, O man, cauſed this blood-ſhed: Thy guilt this ſweat; that was the Sword, this the fire which made this blood and ſweat. <hi>Adam</hi> ſinn'd in a Garden, Chriſt there ſweats for it; his day luſt made this night ſweat.

Beſides <hi>Geth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemane's</hi> pains, <hi>Golgotha's</hi> was upon him, thoſe floods of blood foreſeen made theſe drops trickle. The paſſion then to be act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his body was now imprinted in his minde; the rage of Hell, the wrath of Heaven, the wretchedneſs of man, ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man, for whoſe ſake all this was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, to ſave him from that wrath and Hell. Heaven, Earth, and Hell, all in Union to afflict one (though God, and Man) muſt needs make a heavy conflict, a bloody Agony.

The firſt drawn from his Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, I finde no fault in him; nor yet <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> he is an innocent Perſon; one ſo far from deſerving death, and that I cannot finde he ever did any thing to merit a reproof; (malice it ſelf cannot tax him of any Crime except innocency be Criminal) here I bring him forth to you, that you may know that he is clear from all obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and nothing juſtly to be laid to his charge; and no fault, no ſentence. I that ſit in the place of Judicature muſt not commit ſo great a piece of injuſtice as the ſentencing an Innocent to death. But this not ſatisfying the multitude, he delivers him over to bloody chaſtiſements: ſo he is torn with Whips, crowned with Thorns, blind-folded, derided, and buffeted, even to the wearying of his tormentors. <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> (being himſelf mov'd with pitty at the ſight) preſents him in this forlorne and dolorous condition to them; that his blood might become a mantle to him; that if his innocency could not ſpeak ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently for him, his ſorrows might. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98496:62"/>the man,</hi> behold an Innocent affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, one without Crime miſerably cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiz'd; who can behold him without pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, no heart (unleſs harder then Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant) but muſt needs melt into tears at ſuch a ſight, no malice (except altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther implacable) but would be appeas'd with ſuch ſharp and ſo underſerved re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. I appeal to you all whether he be not an object of pitty rather then fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cruelty; and whether you have not greater reaſon to bewail his miſery then increaſe it: but this will not do. No ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows which are not mortal; no ſufferings which are not deadly; no blood but the heart-blood can ſatisfie the malicious; and therefore albeit crown'd with Thorns, and flead with Whips, they ſtill cry Execution, Execution; <hi>Let him be crucified.</hi>

               <p>But <hi>Pilate</hi> (notwithſtanding theſe obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate repulſes) again ſolicites them to ſave his life, (and that his arguments might be crown'd with ſucceſs) he changes his ſtile from a man of ſorrows, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents him as a king of ſufferings; that ſo his dignity might prevail where his miſeries could not; and that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98496:62"/>of the ſufferer might aggravate his ſufferings and their cruelty, beſpeaks them thus: <hi>Behold your King,</hi> behold a king deprived of his comforts, ſpoiled of all his goods, ſold by his brethren, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by his ſubjects, ſcourged as a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, derided as a fool.

For my part Ile have no hand in it, and let me adviſe you to have none neither; wherefore let me requeſt you to deſiſt from ſo bloody a deſign. And if ye have no regard neither to his innocency, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, nor majeſty, look upon your own reputations, which will ſuffer much for putting ſuch a perſon to death. Do not you know (I mean you that are the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98496:63"/>of the Law, and the Elders of the People) that the name of a King is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, God owns it as one of his Titles, and them as his Vicegerents that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf, who is the great Monarch of Heaven and Earth; and their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as ſacred as their names, being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to no Tribunal but that of Heaven; no Judge but the higheſt: Wherefore to offer violence to one that bears that Title, were a piece of ſuch unparallel'd cruelty, for which your ſelves could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no example, nor the world a preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; all nations would cry ſhame at ſo horrid a fact, and your own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences would fly in your faces for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſo hainous a Crime. A way then with ſo bloody a motion; you that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend your ſelves ſuch Zealots, ſtain not your hands with ſuch blood, nor your ſouls with the guilt of it, left ye bring ſuch an odium on your Nation, which your ſelves nor poſterity ſhall be ever able to take off. But all his rhetorick will not ſerve turne, for their guilty conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences told them that they had already done more then they could juſtifie: Therefore the more he perſwades, the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98496:63"/>more they exclaim, leſt their King might have out-liv'd his wounds, recover'd his loſſes, and turn'd his Reed into a Scepter; they earneſtly importune the Judge to diſpatch him. Let him be be Crucified. He is no King of ours: If he were, we ſhould not thus proſecute him: <hi>We have no King but Caeſar,</hi> and thou art not <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> friend if thou let him go. 'Tis not his innocency, nor his ſorrows, nor his majeſty which thou ſo much plead'ſt for, ſhall ſatisfie us? 'tis his deſerved death, which we ſue for, and nought but that ſhall excuſe him. Take thou no care, if he dye unjuſtly, the guilt ſhall lie on us, not thee. Wherefore act thou thy part, perform thy office, and we will ours; as thou ſitteſt in judgement to do juſtice, expreſs it by thy condemnation of this man. Thou ſeeſt the proofs are clear, and evidence perſpicuous. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without any more delayes, excuſes, or apologies, pronounce the ſentence, we will ſee it executed.</p>

In order to which, he is led forth of the holy (now the bloody) City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the place of execution, bearing his own Croſs, his head adorn'd with his Crown of Thorns, which was not at all pul'd off,

How are all his ſenſes at once tormented in him; (and he in all of them) his eies in ſeeing nothing but what diſconſolated and afflicted him; either his enemies rejoycing at his ſufferings, or his friends (thoſe few poor friends he had) lamenting his miſeries. His ears play'd upon from every ſide with whole volleys of fearful blaſphemies; <hi>If thou be the King of Iſrael deſcend from the

For his taſte, he had nothing adminiſtred it, to ſweeten the bitterneſs of death, but Gall and Vinegar. For his feeling, we have ſpoken of that before (if it were not altogether unſpeakable what he felt.) In a word, all heads are working, and all hands buſied in length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his torments, and now tormentors and tormented both weary, (the one in doing the other in ſuffering) he yeilds up the ghoſt. But their malice doth not terminate with him, though he be dead, their malice ſtill lives, which we ſhall ſee preſently break forth; for though <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> (one of their councel, but not againſt his life) had begg'd the body of <hi>Pilate,</hi> they alſo go to <hi>Pilate</hi> fraught with malice againſt his memory, (that had done their worſt to his perſon, and beſpeak <hi>Pilate;</hi> Sir, <hi>This deceiver ſaid whilſt he was yet alive, that in three dayes he ſhould riſe again;

                  <hi>O fools and ſlow of heart to believe what the Prophets have ſpoken; ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into his glory!</hi> was he not long before propheſied of to come in the form of a ſervant, not in the gayiſh magnificence of an earthly prince; that he ſhould be a man of ſorrows, and by his ſufferings ſhould purchaſe freedom and happineſs for inthral'd mankinde. How exactly doth your Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> pourtray to the life both his perſon and ſufferings, and writes of him in the Preſent Tenſe not the Future, as a thing then really acted, not after to be fulfilled; as more becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Evangeliſt then a Prophet, in giving rather a Hiſtory of his ſufferings then a Prediction of them: but leſt ye ſhould not think one witneſs enough, look upon all the Prophets that have been ſince the world began, you will finde, they did all unanimouſly breathe with one mouth the myſtery of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of that redemption which by his death he was to accompliſh. Was not his Birth long before propheſied of, as to the time, manner, and place of it, his perſon, names, and offices, his tribe and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98496:67"/>Family, his eternal Generation, the union of his God-head with his Humanity, his Humiliation upon earth, his perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Father, his riding to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem in triumph, the childrens <hi>Hoſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's,</hi> his Agony in the Garden, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his delivery, the price he was ſold for, the flight of his Diſciples, the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his garments, the piercing his hands and his feet, his revilings on the Croſs, his companions in death, his patience in ſuffering, his dying words for whom be ſhould lay down his life, and whom he ſhould conquer; and what clearer proof could ye deſire then the mouths and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of ſo many witneſſes: and could ye be ſo blinde as not to diſcover this to be he that was of old deſign'd and foretold to be the worlds Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: did ye not behold a majeſty in the ſufferer? did not the refulgent beams of his divinity ſhine through the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt clouds of his adverſity? and did not Humility and Glory go hand in hand through the ſeveral paſſages of his life and death, that by miracles as well as miſeries he might convince the world? That he ſhould abaſe himſelf ſo low, as
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98496:67"/>to be born of a Virgin, that ſpake his humility; but to have his incarnation publiſht by an heavenly hoſt, and kings to riſe to the brightneſs of his coming, this his glory: to ſuffer himſelf to be baptized in the common river of <hi>Jordan,</hi> that ſpeaks his humility; but there to be proclaim'd the onely beloved Son and Saviour of the world, both by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Father, and preſence of the Holy Ghoſt, this his glory: to receive the ſlaunders of his Countrey-men, that he caſt out devils by <hi>Belzebub,</hi> that ſpake his humility; but to make the devils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs him to be the Son of the Higheſt, this his glory: to ſuffer death, even the death of the Croſs, that ſpeaks his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; but to make the foundations of the world to ſhake, the Sun to vail it ſelf in black, the moon to hide her head, the rocks to rend, and the vail of the temple to part in ſunder at his yielding up of the ghoſt, this his glory: to be laid in another mans Sepulchre, that ſhews his humility; but to make the Graves to open to receive him as their Lord, and the dead to riſe to atteſt his Divinity, this his glory: to ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98496:68"/>to be ſeal'd up in his Sepulchre with a guard of Souldiers to keep him there, that was humility; but in that houſe of death to have the viſits of Angels, and to riſe from thence by his own power, this his glory: to ſojourn forty dayes on that earth where he had been ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly handled ſpeaks his humility; but to have a convoy of Angels to fetch him away, and to aſcend on high with ſuch a guard of attendants in view of ſo many witneſſes, this his glory. And thus did he evidence his mediatorſhip by the loweſt humiliation of his humanity, and exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his divinity, by the glorious mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; by the one he did do, and the inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable injuries in the other, he did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo. How many glorious miracles did he work, certainly if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> they had repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted long ago in ſackcloth and aſhes. Did he not ſeed your admiring multitudes 5000 of them at one time with five bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley loaves and two fiſhes, and twelve baskets of fragments to ſpare? did he not turn water into wine, heal the ſick, make the lame to walk, the deaf to hear, the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98496:68"/>blinde to ſee, and the dumb to ſing? did he not cleanſe the Leper, caſt out Devils, raiſe the dead, even a <hi>Lazarus</hi> that had been a four dayes priſoner in the Grave? Many things of him were remarkable, and ſuited with him as he was the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> as to his Birth, Death, and Burial: he was born under <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> at ſuch a time, when there was an univerſal peace o're the whole world; to ſhew that he was the prince of peace, and came to reconcile his Father to fallen man. In <hi>Bethlehem</hi> the houſe of bread, for him that was the bread of life, and the life of the world. In an Inne, (a place of common reſort for all perſons) to ſhew that all perſons ſhould have free admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to him, and that he was in publick to manifeſt himſelf to the world. He was Crucified without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> to ſhew that he died for thoſe out of the pale of the Church; on Mount <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary,</hi> a place of death, to ſhew that he came to deſtroy death; on a Croſs, to ſhew that that was the way to a Crown; and by his ſufferings on that tree of ſhame, he purchaſt for us diadems of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He was buried in a Grave cut out of a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98496:69"/>Rock to ſhew that he was the Stone cut out of the Mountain; a Grave untoucht, for a body undefil'd, in a Garden where mankinde was loſt, for him by whom the world was ſaved. But this is not all, he was a King, and ſuch a one you lookt for; but here's the difference, you lookt for one to come in outward pomp and ſplendor, he in meekneſs and humility; (for the glory of his kingdom conſiſts not in outward ſhew, but hidden ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor) you lookt for a temporal Savior, he an eternal; you, to be freed in bodies and eſtates, he to ſave your ſouls; (in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of which the whole world is not worthy a name) you to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the Roman yoke, he from the Devils tyranny. The weapons of his warfare were ſpiritual, and his glory not temporal, witneſs his progreſs to the Royal City; for inſtead of Chariots, and Steeds, and Trains of State, he hath not a beaſt, but a borrowed one, to ride up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no Crown on his head, no Scepter in his hand, no Cloth of State over him, no precious Furniture about him, no Tiſſue upon him, no Capariſons of Gold under him. No rich Carpets and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98496:69"/>curious Tapeſtries before him. No He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds in robes. No Clarions. No Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets to proclaim him. And yet <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his glory was not arrayed like this Lilly of the Vallies. No Coats of Arms like his Fiſher-mens. No Laurels to the peoples Boughs. No veſts of beaten gold to their ſpread Clothes. No Troops of Nobles to his Trains. No Grandees to his Diſciples (which have even the Devils themſelves for their ſubjects) no Heralds to the Babes that bleſs him. No <hi>Salve's,</hi> no <hi>Jo's,</hi> no <hi>Ave's</hi> to the Hoſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's and Beniſons beſtowed on him. He was a King (as he told <hi>Pilate</hi>) but 'twas of another world: his Throne Heaven, the Angels his Courtiers, and the whole Creation his Subjects; his Judicatory the Courts of Conſcience and Church Tribunals, and at Doomſday the Clouds. It was ordered by Divine Providence that you ſhould put him to death, elſe you ſhould never have had the power to have done it. Had he pleas'd he could have call'd Legions of Angels to his reſcue, (one of which armed with his permiſſion able to deſtroy a world. In teſtimony of which, did not the

Was not a whole band of you ſtruck down with a word of his Mouth, and can a watch keep him from riſing up; though your Souldiers be too ſtrong for weak Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, are they able to contend with Angels? 'Twas ſtrange that he that was immortal ſhould taſte of death, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible he ſhould ſee corruption. Wherefore notwithſtanding all your guards he ſhall riſe the third day; all the powers of hell ſhall be too weak to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him longer, or hinder his return to his Fathers Boſome, there to continue till the laſt day: and then this Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Son ſhall come in the Clouds with Power and great Glory, and thoſe ſilly Fiſhermen ſit upon twelve Thorns, and judge the twelve Tribes of Iſrael.

               <p>And now dear Chriſtian, let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt thee ſeriouſly to look back, admire, and make a right uſe of thy Saviours ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, behold his readineſs to ſuffer, his willingleſs to ſave, the unſpeakable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his pains, the greatneſs of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and the luſter of his victory: how ready was he to ſave, how did his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els yearn for loſt man; after the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael was he come, and to ſave ſinners was his errand? how ready was he to lay down his life? when they came with Swords and Staves to apprehend him, did he not betray him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his ſo ready a confeſſion, <hi>I am he.</hi> How did he haſten that bitter cup, and how was he ſtraitned till he did ſuffer? did he not forbid Saint <hi>Peter</hi> the uſe of his Sword, though in ſo juſt a quarrel as his defence? how ready was he to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, how meek and patient in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; was he not the Lamb dumb
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98496:71"/>before the ſhearers that opened not his mouth; who being revil'd, revil'd not again, but prayed for his enemies whilſt they blaſphem'd him; which prayer of his was ſo prevalent with his father, that in fifty five dayes it occaſioned the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of eight thouſand of his enemies at one time. Chriſts ſufferings did as far tranſcend any other as his Perſon; but they were but for a time (they did not laſt alwayes) every Day hath his Night, every Summer its Winter, every Spring his Fall, and every Life his Death; and as ſome nights are darker then other, ſome Autumns more unſeaſonable, ſome Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters more ſharp, and ſome Deaths more (yea much more) cruel then others be: ſome men fall like fruit, others are cut down like trees; ſome cut up as the flower, others by the root; ſome men dye onely, others with torment, (which is two or more deaths in one;) but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all deaths that ever were ſuffer'd; never any ſo ſtrange, never any ſo ſad as our Saviours was; for in it both pain and patience met in their extremities; pain did her worſt to overcome pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and patience her beſt to overcome
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98496:71"/>pain; and yet neither had pain the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand, though it kil'd, nor patience loſt, though Chriſt dyed; ſuch was his paſſion, that the whole world cannot ſample it with its parallel; for Chriſts pain was ſuch, as never creature felt, and his patience ſo great, as for all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row he felt on the Croſs, he is not ſaid to have utter'd a groan there; ſo that it may eaſily be diſcerned, that patience had the victory, becauſe pain could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make her leave the field till ſhe liſt, nor bring her to any conditions but her own (which were moſt honourable.) Though God be crucified, Life be dead, and Righteouſneſs ſuſter, all effected, yet nothing done to advance the contrary party. For through his body, Death ſlue it ſelf, and Sin and Satan took their deadly wounds; for now the fleſh hath loſt her life, and ſin in that, his throne; and death with it, his ſting; and the grave (with this) his power; and hell with them, her keys; and the devil with all his victory, whilſt he hangs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicably on the tree of ſhame, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of hell are dragg'd captive after the triumphant Chariot of his Croſs.</p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:98496:72"/>
               <p>Well might he therefore ſay, <hi>'Tis fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed;</hi> for the Satisfaction is full, Salvation ſure, Sin is nail'd, Hell foil'd, Satan chain'd, the World baffled, the Fleſh wounded, Death ſlain, the Grave buried, and every Adverſary-power conquer'd by Chriſt Triumphant over all; all is fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, mans redemption compleated, and that perfected he came about. <hi>This is a true ſaying and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what is all this to us, what is it to know that Chriſt is a Saviour if he be not ours? what to know, that he came to ſave the world, if we are not one of the world, he came to ſave; what to know, that his death is ſatisfactory, to expiate the Juſtice of his Father, if we have no intereſt in it. I anſwer, that as Chriſt hath done his part ſo muſt we do ours, (if ever we hope to have part in his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) he never came to ſave any that had no minde of ſalvation, (or to uſe thoſe means which he hath appointed for all thoſe that ſhall inherit eternal life) as he did both do and ſuffer for us, 'tis requiſite we ſhould either do or ſuffer,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98496:72"/>ſomething for him. His love to us, and ſufferings for us were unſpeakable, and they juſtly challenge our deepeſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and admiration, that he ſhould pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe our happineſs at ſo dear a rate as his own Blood; that God ſhould be in Gore, that man might be in Bliſs; the Prince of Life ſhould dye, that the Childe of Death might live; that he ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer on a Croſs, that we might not in Hell. Did he ſweat for our guilt, and ſhall not we weep for our own, and diſſolve into love and tears for our dying Lord. O my ſoul ſhew thy affection to him, that expreſt ſo much to thee! love him above thy life, to ſerve him think mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones light, to ſuffer for him make tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures pleaſures, hate ſin more then death, the Crown of pride as his Throns, thy hearts luſt, as his ſpear; thy iron neck and evil works and wayes, as his nails, their habit, as his hammer which drives them home into his heart, and his hands, and feet. Think not any thing enough thou ſuffereſt for his ſake (that ſuffer'd ſo much for thine.) Though violent Tongues were laid on our Credit. Hands of Rapine on our Eſtates, of Bondage on
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98496:73"/>our Perſons, of Blood on our Lives, be ſo far from ſhrinking at it, that hadſt thou for one a thouſand ſouls, give all to his ſervice; a thouſand bodies, all to his ſuffering; a thouſand heads, all to his ſtudy; a thouſand hearts, bate not one to thy Saviour; a thouſand lives, lay out all to his honour. Hadſt thou for two two thouſand hands, let them all do his buſineſs; two thouſand feet, let them all go his errands: if thou ſhouldſt not, thou wert unworthy of ſuch a Saviour.</p>
               <p>Now that we may know the cauſe (or cauſes) of Chriſts coming, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand our own duty, (in order to the making it a happy coming to us) be pleaſed to take notice of theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars.</p>
               <p>There are (ſaith one) four cauſes of mans ſalvation: The Efficient cauſe. The Meritorious cauſe. The Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal cauſe. And the Final cauſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Efficient cauſe, which is the love of God. 'Twas Gods love to the world that cauſed him to ſend his Son into the world. Had he not loved the world, he would not have permitted his Son to dye for the world. And he that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98496:73"/>denied us not his Son, who is Heir of all things, will not deny us any thing whereof he is heir.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Meritorious cauſe, That is Chriſt. 'Twas his Merits that purchaſt our happineſs: his Blood that gives us a right and title to that glorious, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and unfading Inheritance, which he aforehand hath taken poſſeſſion of.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Inſtrumental cauſe, that is Faith. Chriſt is the onely cure of our leprous ſouls, Faith the hand to convey his merits to us. Suppoſe a plaiſter of a ſoveraign nature were laid by a man dangerouſly wounded, be the plaiſter never ſo excellent, he may dye of his wounds if it be not applied to him, (for without an active hand to apply the plaiſter to the ſore, the worth of it is not at all available.) Chriſt (ſaith one) may be compared to ſope, Faith to the hand of the Landreſs: though ſope (in it ſelf) be of a purifying nature, yet without the hand of the Landreſs it does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>we are ſaved by Faith;</hi> but that we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what that ſaving Faith is which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, we are to preſent it
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98496:74"/>firſt in the Negative, what 'tis not; then in the Affirmative, what it is. Not an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Faith onely, for that the Devils and damned in hell have, (that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receive any benefit at all by the death of Chriſt) they know that Chriſt came into the world, and that he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that a day will come in which he ſhall be revealed from heaven in fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire, when he ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> take vengeance on all the ungodly of the earth, and compleat their torments. Not a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Faith: 'tis not to be a Saint for ones ends, and a Devil at ones pleaſure; they that make a profeſſion of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity muſt perſevere to the end, for none but he that endures to the end, ſhall reach the end of Chriſts coming, or his own ſalvation. It muſt not be a Mental Faith neither: 'tis not the hearer, or the ſpeaker, but the doer that ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Many that ſhall ſay, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> ſhall be ſhut out of his Kingdom. It muſt be a true Faith, and to evidence it to be ſuch a one, it muſt work by love, breaking forth into practice, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth fruit worthy of repentance, and amendment of life. A Faith that's
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98496:74"/>operative in the whole man, and ſhews it ſelf in the life of the believer, that all men may judge of the Cauſe by the Eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cts.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Final cauſe is the glory of God: that the glory of his mercy might as well be advanc't in reducing a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (or ſmall number) out of the maſs of mankinde (under wrath) to chant forth his Praiſes to all eternity, as well as to let his Juſtice manifeſt it ſelf in the condemnation of others, he contriv'd a way to ſave ſome (when all had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe been loſt:) This, this was it that was a motive to induce God to ſend a Saviour to the world to dye for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is a true ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus you have now ſeen the object of my diſcourſe (and of all our faiths) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; you have ſeen the act, what he did, that he came; the end he came for, that it was to ſave; the means by which he did ſave, that it was by ſuffering; thoſe ſufferings, that of death; what death, that of the Croſs: the ſignal vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory he obtain'd by theſe his ſufferings
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98496:75"/>for mankinde (over the enemies of our ſalvation) and the benefits which accrue to mankinde by thoſe ſufferings.</p>
               <p>But this is not all, for as ſure as he came once, he ſhall come again, but not in ſuch obſcurity, but with more reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency: at his firſt coming he was onely viſible to a part or corner of the world; at his ſecond, he ſhall be manifeſt to all, and every Eye ſhall ſee him. That Sun which then ſhin'd on the houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſhall now extend its rayes to all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the earth. He that then came as a Lamb, (the Lamb of God, to take away the ſins of the world) ſhall now come as a Lion (the Lion of the tribe of <hi>Judah</hi>) to judge the world. He that then came in the form of a Servant, ſhall now come in the equipage of a Prince, in the head of a Royal Army of Saints and Angels. As he then came to receive an unjuſt ſentence, he ſhall now come to give right to all nations, and to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the controverſie of mankinde. And they that would not own him in the Manger, ſhall dread him in his Majeſty. They that deſpiſed him in the Clouts, ſhall be afraid to behold him in the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98496:75"/>Clouds. They that denied him at the Bar, ſhall be amazed to ſee him on the Bench. They that derided him on the Croſs, ſhall tremble to ſee him on the Throne. They that would not partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of his Sufferings, ſhall never ſhare in his Triumphs. And thoſe that deny to follow him in Grace, ſhall never reach him in Glory.</p>
               <p>Now, to perſwade our ſelves that we are of the number of thoſe for whom our Saviour ſhed his blood, let us wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs our intereſt in his firſt coming, by our longing for his ſecond: That as the old Character of Gods people was, to wait for the conſolation of Iſrael, (Chriſts firſt coming) we may look and long for his ſecond, as the eſpouſed Maid doth after the Marriage, as the Apprentice for his Freedom, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for his Ranſom, the Traveller for his Inn, the Marriner for the Haven, we may look for and haſten the coming of that day of God. And to this end, that we miſpend not any of our precious; time, but redeem it to our utmoſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and not be weary of well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but perſevering in our devoirs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98496:76"/>him, till we ſhall be tranſlated from theſe tranſient and ſhort lived Troubles, to thoſe tranſcendent, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, and unchangeable Glories. That when the trump, and all mankinde ſtand to receive their doom, we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Judges face with joy.</p>
               <p>In a word, let me one more requeſt you to be conſtant and immoveable, (not to extol him to day and blaſpheme him to morrow) ſing Hoſanna's to day and Crucifige's the next. Though the fickle Rabble change, let us not alter; the Hoſanna's that was then, let us cry now. Cry it at the Croſs with the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Thief, that we may ſing it on the Throne with the glorified Apoſtles; and for the Hoſanna of the Saints, ſing the Hallelujahs of the Angels; when we ſhall receive with their gifts of Bliſs, their tongues and ſongs of Glory. Amen.</p>

In order to which I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the world to view.

               <p>The World for its frailty and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy is by St. <hi>John</hi> compared to a ſea of glaſſe, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.6. For its frailty glaſs, for its inconſtancy a ſea: A ſea ſwelling with pride, blown with envy, boyling with anger, deep with avarice,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98496:77"/>frothy with Luxury: It is a ſea tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous with controverſies, ſtormy with afflictions, tumultuous with diſorders, fraught with vexation and miſery, and all things in it ſweeter in the ambition then fruition. The ſea yields an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent conformity to the motions of the Moon, and ſwells higheſt in a joyfull imitation when ſhe is in the Spring-tyde of her light, either towards the heavens, (as in the change) or towards the earth, (as in the full;) and as ſhe doth wax or wain, ſo doth he either flow into a Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, or ebb into a Conſumption of his waters. And even thus is the World the Page of Fortune, whoſe unconſtant and ever changing motions do hurry about, like ſpokes in a wheel, the condition of all Mortalls. We have it confirmed to us by a more then humane authority, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31.) <hi>That the glory of this world paſſeth away.</hi> An Hour-glaſſe doth change its poſture every hour, and that part which was even now above, is now below; that which was but now full, is now empty; nor can one ſide be filled, but by emptying the other. Such is the world, every moment turn'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98496:78"/>down, and men are now full, now empty: Nor can they often fill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without the ruine and prejudice of others; and although ſometimes it be at the full of glory, yet is it even then like her alſo mingled with the ſpots of adverſity, and ſubject to the change of every moment. And therefore (as 'tis reported) at the Conſecration of the Popes, the Maſter of the Ceremonies going before carries in one hand a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Taper, in the other a ſtick with ſome flax tied on the top thereof; which he ſetting on fire, cries with a loud voice, <hi>Pater ſancte, Sic tranſit gloria mundi:</hi> Holy Father, ſo paſſeth away the glory of this world.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98496:80"/>denied a burying place. Queen <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi> once ſo formidible, as to be rather fear'd then contemn'd by her neighbour Princes, ſhe drank Jewels deſolv'd (a draught worth a Kingdom) expir'd on a dunghill. <hi>Guillemer</hi> King of the Goths, who long reigned in ſo much proſperity, but taken Priſoner by <hi>Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarius,</hi> was reduc't to ſo much miſery, that he onely beg'd theſe things of the Conquerour, Bread and Water, (the one to keep him from famiſhing, the other from thirſt) a ſpunge to wipe his eyes, and a harp to tune his ſorrows to. <hi>Andronicus</hi> Emperour of the Eaſt, (a man of ſuch large and vaſt Dominions, that his very name was terrible to all Neighbour-Kings) all his glory is eclipſt in one Battel, and he delivered into the hands of thoſe who think themſelves happy in inventing and inflicting new tortures; he is thrown into the common Goal, where the beſt ſents are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of nature; taken thence, and derided and abus'd through the ſtreets of the City, put to open diſgrace in the Market-place: and to the further grief of ſo great a ſpirit, the muddy brain'd
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98496:80"/>Rabble, are both his Judges and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great (who was ſaid to conquer the World) could not guard his own perſon from a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and untimely death. He that had vanquiſht a world, was himſelf over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by an inferiour perſon in it, poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned to death, and his corpſe for thirty dayes denied a burying place; his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts above ground gave him no title to a poſſeſſion under ground. So our <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour lay three dayes unburied, (he that had vanquiſht King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms living, is denied ſix foot of ground being dead.) <hi>Coriolanus</hi> (that famous Grecian) who was once admir'd and fear'd of all, murthered openly in the Market-place at <hi>Antium,</hi> and none to pitty him, or take his part. <hi>Philopoemen</hi> forc't to expire by a cup of poiſon from the hands of a Hangman.

Firſt, Honours.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:98496:81"/>Suppoſe a man were at the height of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, his Throne as high as <hi>Babels</hi> Tower, and all the Potentates of the earth proſtrate themſelves at his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool, and all perſons of all ranks, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, degrees, and conditions admire and adore him, had he ten thouſand times as many titles, as that cracking Spaniard at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to his Maſter, and his territories as vaſt as the univerſe; yet all theſe would be ſo far from giving true felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it would but load, him with cares and miſeries. Crowns are but ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did vanities, and vexation and mutation the ordinary attendants of Diadems. Crowns are full of cares, and high places not without their fears, which made one King cry out, (concerning his Diadem) Were it but known how many miſeries and moleſtations do attend thee, none would dare to take thee up lying at his feet. <hi>Antonius</hi> the Philoſopher ſaid of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that the Empire was an ocean of miſchiefs; and one caus'd it to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon his Tomb, Happy had I been if I had never reigned.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98496:82"/>with three Furies. Envy in the eye, Jealouſie in the ear, and Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the heart. Envy in the eye: It grieves him more to ſee one above him, then ten thouſand below him. <hi>Haman</hi> was more diſtracted with <hi>Mordecai</hi> the Jew's ſitting in the Kings gate with a careleſs neglect, then he was delighted with all the reverence and adoration which others gave him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Jealouſie in the ear, alwayes fearful of Competetours; he thinks himſelf never ſecure; every thing he hears makes him ſuſpicious of ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching danger; and if any but whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in his preſence, he is unſatisfied till he underſtands it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Covetouſneſs in the heart. If (againſt his will) he empty ſome of his bags in the progreſs of his ambition, he will not be himſef, till he hath refill'd them by extorted oppreſſion; and when he poſſeſſes moſt, is leaſt ſatisfied when he has conſidered with how much toyl &amp; trouble he purchaſt it; with how much care &amp; fear he preſerves it, &amp; knows not how ſuddenly muſt part from it; either it may be taken from him by violence, or he
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98496:82"/>from it by treachery; and ſo his enemies become Lords and Maſters of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and eat the fruit of his labours. Who would be in love with that which hath ſuch Furies for its Attendants?</p>
               <p>'Tis ſeldom ſeen, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt darlings of the world enjoy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect contentment, (be they never ſo well deſerving) ſomething they ſhall have to complain of that ſhall give an unſavory verdure to their ſweeteſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, and make their very felicity miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Multitude of buſineſs baniſh ſleep from the eye-lids of Kings, and make the night troubleſome; and fear many times keeps them waking, (though in a Palace) leſt ſome <hi>Achitophel</hi> ſhould be projecting to turn his ſilent ſlumbers into a ſleep of death, whileſt the ruſtick Swain ſnores ſecurely in his loomy Cottage. <hi>Bajazet</hi> Emperour of the Turks thought a ſhepheard (whom he heard whiſtling on a hill) to be a happier man then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and (if I miſtake not) the event gives me ſufficient cauſe to be of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for he was ſhortly after taken Priſoner by <hi>Tamerlain</hi> the Scythian, who loads him with golden fetters, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſes

If he begins to fall, he will fall to purpoſe: (as <hi>Zereſh</hi> unlucky told <hi>Haman</hi>) If his feet begin to ſlip on the ſteep hill of honour, his own weight will down with him to the bottom: once paſt noon with him, it is preſently night: there is but a ſtep (ſaid that mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of men) 'twixt the priſons and graves of Princes.</p>
               <p>The Airy Chair, though it be conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, is (you ſee) full of dangers. He ſtands ſureſt that hath no aſcent to fall from, the higheſt riſer hath ever the loweſt fall: few of the magnifices of this world ever left it with rejoycing, or parted in peace, but hurried with violence to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely graves.

Thoſe who have thought to have juſtled the ſtars out of their places, and made their neſts as high or higher, have had their glory laid in the duſt, and their honour in diſgrace; and thoſe who all men (in their lives) have judg'd the happieſt, have, ere they parted with the world, lamentably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd the contrary. Earthly glories are (at beſt) but tranſient. The greateſt Favorite that ever the world had could never aſſure himſelf of one minute of happineſſe, (but ever obnoxious to thoſe lamentable hazards and mutations inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to greatneſſe.) How many are there that laught yeſterday, that have cauſe enough to weep to day. He on whom proſperity yeſterday did ſmile, doth to day adverſity frown. He that yeſterday was reputed the happieſt man in this world, is to day ſent miſerable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.

This tranſitory traſh could neither ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter comfort, or prevent miſery; as there is no true happineſs in them, ſo no conſtancy in enjoying them: for they are ſubject to vanity and violence; and they would be ſo far from protecting him from danger, that they would make
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98496:84"/>him a mark for envy to ſhoot at, he ſhould to his ſorrow finde that there would be men found that would not ſtartle at his deſtruction, ſo they might by it attain their deſires, deceive, betray, ſwear, and forſwear for ſuch a purchaſe. Riches indeed were never true to thoſe that truſted them; <hi>They take themſelves wings, and flye away,</hi> when there's moſt occaſion to uſe them.

Pleaſures: Suppoſe the Elements did conſpire to pleaſe the minde of man with their choiceſt delicacies; ſuppoſe the eye were pleas'd with the lovelieſt and moſt deſired objects, the hearing with the ſweeteſt and rareſt harmony that either art or nature could poſſibly produce.

                  <hi>Arabia</hi> (art and nature) could produce. The feeling tickled with the greateſt delights that that ſenſe were capable of, all would be too ſhort to entitle the enjoyer happy, one thing or other will be ſtill wanting, (the abſence of which which will ſtill diſcontent him) one drop of gall will diſtaſte a whole veſſel of ſweets.) Put the caſe all things were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd that can be deſir'd to ſatisfie the expectation, there would ſoon be a glut, (plenty would breed ſatiety.) It may be ſaid after enjoyment, as it was of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> (who was ſo extreamly deſirous of enjoying his ſiſter <hi>Tamar</hi>) when he had his deſire, his loathing now, as great as his longing-before: So here, but this is not all, as they are unſatisfying and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, ſo not conſtant; proſperity and adverſity may ſhew themſelves in one moment. <hi>Belſhazars</hi> frolicks were both ſuddenly and ſadly chang'd into terrour and trembling, by the ſtrange appearance and motion of a hand that predicted his laſt. <hi>Jezabel</hi> (that painted Strumpet, who ſtudied nothing but to pleaſe her ſelf, her will was her law, and her deſires accompliſht, though never

We may ſay of all Earthly Pleaſures what <hi>Amaſa</hi> ſaid of War, that bitterneſſe is the common appendix in the latter end; they ever carry a ſting in the tail, like <hi>Joab</hi> to <hi>Amaſa,</hi> whileſt it kiſſeth us, it killeth us. The world that is ſo ready with her ſervice, is as forward with her deceits: She that but now ſmil'd like a ſtrumpet, frowns like a Tyrant. Worldly Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are like gilded Pills, which under their external beauty include bitterneſs; or like unto freſh Rivers, that end their courſe in the ſea, loſing their ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in an Ocean of ſaltneſs, as will be ſadly manifeſted by this following ek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. <hi>Sejanus</hi> had as much of the worlds felicity as could be wiſht or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fir'd, (if the deſire could be ſatisfied with having) for honours he had them heapt upon him daily; for titles, he is more then Emperour; for his will gives laws to his; his ſtatues are erected
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98496:86"/>in publick paſſages, reverenc't in Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and carried in the front of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions; all perſons do him homage, all tongues ſing his praiſes, and all knees bow to him: Never any man before him recived greater honours, more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, more unexpected, all the favours and dignities which all the Kings of <hi>Europe</hi> could heap together to raiſe a man, might not be compared to theſe; he made all men know (far and near) what he was able to do: he ſixteen years poſſeſt the Sovereign Power of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire that commanded the whole world, and which had the riſing and ſetting Sun for limit. <hi>Euphrates</hi> confin'd its Frontier towards the Eaſt, Mount <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> the Cataracts of <hi>Nylus,</hi> the Deſerts of <hi>Africa</hi> towards the South, the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in the Weſt, <hi>Danubius</hi> in the North; ſo that as far as the ſun progreſſed, his commands went. What Glory ever mounted ſo high, or ſell ſo low, (as the concluſion will acquaint you.)</p>
               <p>For Riches he had ſeventy two milions of gold (at one time) at his command, &amp; more was at his ſervice, if he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. For Pleaſures, Nature did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98496:86"/>her ſelf to ſerve him, and turn'd all things upſide down to delight him. All his enterprizes were crown'd with ſucceſſe; he ſaw his deſire upon his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and was preſented with the heads of thoſe that hated him. He had his ſetting dogs (as <hi>Seneca</hi> term'd them) that were fitted to ſerve him in all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, which were onely tractable and tame to himſelf, and barkt at all others, and were maintained with the blood of his enemies. In this height, adverſity like a ſudden guſt overturns his fortunes, and thoſe, who but now attended him to the Senate-Houſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him to a Priſon: Thoſe who but now bow'd their kuees to adore him, now deridingly ſhake their heads at him, (making a jeaſt of him now whom they fear'd in earneſt before) whileſt he is dragg'd from the Temple to the Goal, from the higheſt honour to the loweſt ſhame. There was ſo little ſpace 'twixt his glory and his fall, that he was aſſoon ſtruck as threatned; 'twas his miſery not to be fore-arm'd for ſuch calamities, nor wiſe till his fall made him ſo. ('Tis a madneſſe for a man that might deſcend

For Riches, none had more; the Gold of Ophir was as plentifull as the ſtones in the ſtreet, and the richeſt Gems that the world afforded ſent him from forreign coaſts.

               <p>To conclude, I hope it will not be thought either impertinent or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to this ſubject, to preſent my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with a brief ſurvey of the various infelicities that attend the ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, conditions, and ages of men, and with an applicatory concluſion to finiſh my Diſcourſe. We will begin with the higheſt, (for 'tis eaſier to fall then riſe) and conclude with the meaneſt: We have already ſufficiently diſcourſt of the miſeries of greatneſſe, and therefore we ſhall be now conciſe, onely acquaint my Readers, that great men are ſo far from being made happy by their greatneſſe, that they are thereby made capable of the greateſt diſtractions and afright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I have read of ſome that durſt not go to bed till one had had lain down there before them; and of others, that durſt not take their repoſe, till their chambers have been ſearcht, leſt ſome conſpiratour ſhould be there lurking for an opportunity to put a ſad exit to their mundane infelicities: Of others that durſt not uſe a Barber, leſt in ſhaving their heads or beards they ſhould cut their throats. Nor is there now a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98496:88"/>in Chriſtendom that dares taſte a bit without a taſter. Nor is this their vigilancy to be diſcommended, for we know that their greatneſs makes them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to many dangers, which renders the greateſt dignities miſerable. Deſcend we to the Noble man: Suppoſe him in the height of honor, (a favorite to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Prince) yet even there is he far from happineſſe; for he is ever fearful of falling, either to be cruſht from above by his ſuperiours anger, or to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd from beneath by his inferiors envy: can he be happy whom a Princes breath can in a moment diveſt him both of his greatneſſe and his life? Come we now to the Gentleman, whoſe education may make him capable of ſerving the Commonwealth in thoſe ſeverall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions into which providence may caſt him: Suppoſe him call'd to the Bar, what happineſſe to be found in that life which is perpetually diſturb'd with diſcord, hears nothing but the invective clamours of inveterate oppoſites; and his beſt muſick the jarring harmony of diſagreeing perſons. If to the Pulpit, that's the ſaddeſt life of all, (if ſeriouſly
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98496:89"/>conſidered) into which being no ſooner caſt, he findes himſelf in a Labyrinth of cares, (having ſo many ſouls under his charge, the thoughts of which doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually afflict him) he muſt labour in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, (and it may be for an ingrateful people that will little reſpect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But let them take their courſe, (as they will without my leave) and feed themſelves (like Porkets) with the fat things of the earth, they ſhall notwithſtanding (at one time or other) finde both vanity and vexation in this their ſuppos'd felicity, enough to render the greateſt happineſſe upon earth truly miſerable. Come we to the Merchant, (who is the fitteſt Embleme of the worlds vanity and inconſtancy) continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al cares do perpetually diſtract him, which hinder his content by day, and repoſe by night, all that he has (and it may be more then his own) lies at the mercy of the ſurging Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and the boiſterous waves, which in an inſtant can make him that was worth thouſands not maſter of a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Come to the Shop-keeper, whoſe head is ever full of cares, how to ſteer
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98496:90"/>his courſe, and manage his buſineſſe with diſcretion to the beſt improvement and advancement of his ſtock, and how to finde out the various diſpoſitions of men, and to ſuit them accordingly (and ſo to demean himſelf towards all as to gain the love of all) and oftentimes troubled at the ſlow motion of back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cuſtomers, whoſe promiſes are commonly more dexterous then their purſes: (not a few have been ruin'd by it.) Come to the Mechanick that has no living, but what he fetches from his fingers ends; how muſt he work both with head and hands to maintain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and thoſe about him? (who it may be will ill reward him for his pains.) Come we now to the Countrey, (which ſome think ſo pleaſant) it is very toilſom. The Countrey-man is the moſt ſenſible of all others of that doom of <hi>Adam,</hi> that with the ſweat of his brows he ſhould eat his bread.</p>
               <p>If we conſider him as a landed man, then he is loaden with cares, ever fearful of bad ſervants and back doors, and it may be of one near to him, who alſo may contribute to his ruine. If a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98496:90"/>he moyls like a ſlave in a Galley, or a Horſe in a Mill, to bring both ends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to preſerve his ſtock, and prepare himſelf for an encounter with his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord; and all too little, if many years of plenty come together, except ſome dear years interpoſe to requite him.</p>
               <p>If a Cottager, one that hath nothing but what he miſerably earns, who by his extraordinory labour gets him a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach ere he has meat to ſuffice to it, whileſt his childrens note is like the Horſe-leech in the Proverbs, crying for meat, and (it may be) none to give it them. We have but one ſtep lower to deſcend, and that is to the Beggar: I know it will be here objected, that I have not done well in putting the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar here to take a ſhare of the infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the world, for he lives the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt life of all, he fetches his Pedigree from <hi>Cain</hi> the eldeſt ſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> (a man of a vaſte eſtate) and hence hath the world for his inheritance, and is paid tribute from all ſorts and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men in it; all heads and hands are buſied to cloath and feed him, whileſt his onely task is to walk from place to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98496:91"/>it; his merry heart is neither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted with cares, nor amazed with fears; he is as far from danger as free from labour: none will conſpire againſt his life, to deprive him of his place. A pennileſſe Traveller can ſing before a Thief, and a money leſſe Beggar can walk ſecurely, where a full fraught Paſſenger dares not ſhew himſelf. (Beggars you muſt note carry not much treaſure about them, the rich man is their Sumpter-Horſe to carry it for them) I anſwer, 'Tis confeſt that the Beggar is freeſt from care, but not furtheſt from miſery. 'Tis true we ſeldom read of any plots that have been laid againſt the Beggars life. This one happineſſe indeed he has, but he hath ſo many miſeries to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance it, (that had he not ſome ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine as well as ſo many ſtorms, he were not able to live, grief would diſpatch him, and put a ſad period to his miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able dayes) he hath a large walk, and is ſeldom out of his way. But by the way I muſt tell you, that he lives a dogs life, hunger and eaſe; as for hunger he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that at moſt times, but for eaſe he hath that but ſometimes; the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98496:91"/>heat annoyes him, the cold doth pinch him, his belly wants ſupplies within, his back wants defence without, both from the Summers ſun, and the Winters ſtorms; he walks regardleſly by day, and is lodg'd as careleſly by night; and though he be no fit object for ambition to work upon, yet is he oft in danger to be ſurprized either for the Stocks or Whipping poſte, notwithſtanding his ten thouſand about him that never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him. The Premiſes conſidered, we may conclude that all things are full of toyl and trouble, moleſtation and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meet us at every turn, (whether we be high or low, rich or poor.) There is a ſingular vanity in this ſplendid miſery; one well compareth it to a beautiful Picture drawn with white and red colors on ſackcloth, which afar off is very love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but near by 'tis like the filthy matter of a ſore or wound. No man ever yet found any conſtant contentation in any ſtate, yet may his outward appearance deceive another, and anothers him. If we but ſeriouſly conſider the various vexations that attend the ſeveral ranks of men, we ſhall finde that abundance
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98496:92"/>is a trouble, and want a miſery, honour a burthen, and baſeneſſe a ſcorn, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements dangerous, and diſgrace odious: (he that climbs is in danger of falling, and he that proſtrates himſelf to be trod upon.) But leaving that, we come to diſcourſe of the ſeveral Ages, and draw to a concluſion.</p>
               <p>Not to ſpeak of his being nine months a cloſe Priſoner in the womb, we will come to his birth. When he comes into the world, how ſadly he ſalutes it weeping, (declaring his diſlike by tears, becauſe he wants words to expreſſe it) either as a Prophet to foretell his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or as a Penitent to bewail them. We will paſſe his Infancy, (which all will acknowledge to be a life of vanity) and come to his Adolency, where he is kept under the tyranny of parents and maſters, and terrified with thoſe terrible engins of correction, the rod and cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell: (an eſtate, ſaith one, not worth the deſcription.) Come we now to his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, where the cares of the world (like a Troop) beſet him. Does he live ſingle, that's uncomfortable? Is he married, that's troubleſome. I have
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98496:92"/>read of one <hi>Diponares</hi> (who having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſled the martyrdom of marriage) (as a French Authour terms it) ſaid, that there were but two good dayes which a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried man was capable of; the one his wedding day, on which much good chear was provided, and the Bride freſh and fair, (for of all pleaſures the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is moſt delectable.) The other when the woman died, the man being then free from bondage. But I believe <hi>Diponares</hi> was in a more then ordinary meaſure incenſt (by the croſneſſe of his own in particular) to inveigh againſt all in general; (but ſuch large concluſions are neither warrantable or commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) and therefore let my Readers know I am not of his opinion. Come we now to the old man, (who is as wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the world, as the world of him) his brain troubled, his face wither'd, his body crook'd, his ſight dim'd, his hairs faln, his teeth rotten, his comfort and content is gone, (all his happy dayes are flown over) the day is troubleſome, and the night tedious. In this condition he is ſo far from being happy, that he is perfectly miſerable, a burthen to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98496:93"/>and all about him, all his paſt felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are ſo far from contributing to his preſent felicity, that the very thoughts of them does diſtract him, when he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that he had a prime: but that was paſt, and that thoſe pleaſures which were then green are now withered. If a rich man, then his children are apt to blame the ſlowneſſe of his motion to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world, (for they have been long weary of him in this.) If a poor man, then he is troubleſome to one and to another, his children (if he have any) ſhift him from one to another, every one thinks he doth too much for him, grudging him every bit he eats as rob'd from them and theirs; and if ever they beg any thing at Gods hands, 'tis to take him away. Come we now to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, when he is ready to take his leave of the world, his feet become cold, his face pale, his eyes hollow, his tongue waxeth black, his teeth cloſe, and his breath fails, he hath no ſenſe left him, but that of miſery, his children and relation about him gaping for his long deſired laſt gaſp, that ſo they may frol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick with that wealth which was long
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98496:93"/>kept from them by one that was incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of enjoying it; he leaves the world with groans, as he ſaluted it at firſt with tears, (and now what is become of his glory) he is brought to the grave, where all mankinde are promiſcuouſly blended together without diſtinction or order. Here are no Heralds to blazon Coats of Arms, but worms to disfigure thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that did bear them.

               <p>And thus have I (according to my ſlender abilities preſented my Readers with a ſerious and ſad Portraiture of the Miſery and Mutability of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Glory, which I have illuſtrated by the various diſpenſations of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to her greateſt Favorites, by a through examination of the ſeverall ranks and degrees of men, from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch to the Beggar, and of the ſeveral Ages, from the Young Mans <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the Old Mans <hi>Exodus.</hi> What now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98496:94"/>but that I onely leave my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſome ſhort advices, (in order to his making a right uſe of the foregoing Diſcourſe) in number four, which I ſhall diſpatch in words almoſt as few. The firſt to contemn the world. The ſecond, to be content with our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The third, to uſe moderation in the things of this world. And the laſt, that we wiſely improve them to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in a better.</p>
               <p>Firſt to contemn the World: Alas there is nothing in it worth the deſiring, all the glory, beauty, and pleaſures of this world are as truly ſhort as they are ſeeming ſweet; and though they may to ſome ſeem ſweet in the enjoying, they are certainly (to all) bitter in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. I have read of a Duke of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> who dying, commanded this to be written upon his Tomb, Know (moſt noble Venetians) that by mine exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, 'tis the moſt Chriſtian thing in the world to trample this world under your feet. <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us of a wiſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, who ſpeaking of the delights and paſtimes of thoſe times, ſaid, I am much taken that I am not more taken with
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98496:95"/>theſe pleaſures: And ſhall that which could not pleaſe an Heathen ſatisfie a Chriſtian? We are not Heathens but Chriſtians, (whoſe expectations reach further then ever Heathens did) and ſhall we loſe time in looking after fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding toyes, that ſhould be curiouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive after unfading joyes, and for tranſitory traſh loſe a Crown of glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we content our ſelves with that condition into which Providence hath placed us, and endeavour with faithfulneſs to diſcharge thoſe places into which God hath call'd us, and not to ſquint upon other mens profeſſions, to invert that order which God himſelf hath made. Let not the Shoemaker go beyond his laſt, let the Cobler attend his boot, the Waterman his boat, the Fiſherman his bait, and the Schollar his books, a hammer is for the Smith, a <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> for the School: God never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that bungling Mechanicks ſhould botch at his Altar, or thoſe that ſerve at his Altar ſhould minde any thing elſe. The gift of contentation is ſuch a bleſſing as God affords to none but to his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, 'tis that which renders the meaneſt condition amiable</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:98496:95"/>
               <p n="3">3. To uſe a Moderation in the things of this world, we are not to glut our ſelves with the pleaſures of this world, but to be raviſht with the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a better; not like the Epicure, to place our felicity in out throat, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our ſenſes (which God intended as Handmaids to our Reaſon) ſole Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of our Religion; we may make uſe of the pleaſures of this world, but not abuſe them; they are to be us'd as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, not as food; a little may delight us, much will deſtroy us; we are to uſe a mean and moderation in theſe worldly things, and to uſe this world as though we us'd it not.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that we make a right uſe and wiſe improvement of the things of this world in order to our happineſs in a better; and to this end that we make uſe of thoſe opportunities God hath put in our hands, and of thoſe eſtates where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he hath entruſted us, to his glory, and the good of his poor members, that our gold and our ſilver may ſpeak for us, not againſt us at the laſt day; and by ſo judicious a diſtribution of our eſtates, we ſhall gain ſuch friends by this Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98496:96"/>of unrighteouſneſs, (when time ſhall be no more. and the world with all its glory on a flame) we ſhall be re-received into thoſe eternal (never peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing) habitations in the new <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> to the innumerable company of Angels, and the ſpirit of juſt men made perfect; where with thoſe elders we ſhall vail our crowns at his feet, who is worthy of Honour and Dominion, and ſing perpetual Anthems to the Sacred Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to all eternity.</p>

If proſperity and adverſity were
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98496:97"/>the infallible ſigns of a happy or miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man, who ſo happy as the Sinner, who ſo miſerable as the Saint? Do not we often ſee the guilty here go free, and the innocent bear the puniſhment, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in fetters, and vice at liberty ranting it in pomp, the ſentence pardons Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and layes hold on Doves; the poor innocent afflicted, whileſt the wicked holds up his head gloriouſly. If outward appearance therefore ſhould be the judge, woe were the portion of the Saints, happineſs the Sinners: For (as a late reverend Father of the Church of <hi>England</hi> obſerves) if we ſhould judge according to appearance, we ſhould think baſely of the Saviour of the world himſelf.

Yet even in this while to the cutting off the ſinnews of thoſe ſtiff-necked Jews, the Angels owned him for their Lord, the Sages ador'd him, the Star deſign'd him, the Prophets foreſhew'd him, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils confeſt him, his miracles evinc't him, the earth ſhook, the rocks rent, the dead lookt out, the ſun lookt in, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered at the ſuffering of the God of nature? Even while he was deſpis'd of men, he commanded the Devils to their chains; whileſt baſe men ſhoot out their tongues at him, principalities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers bowed their knees to him; whileſt he he hang'd deſpicably on the tree of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98496:98"/>ſhame, the powers of hell were drag'd captive after the triumphant chariot of his Croſs; the appearance was not ſo contemptible as the truth of his eſtate glorious, judge not therefore according to appearance: ſhould appearance be the rule, woe were Gods people, happy were his enemies.

Yet we know <hi>Cains</hi> victory was as woful as <hi>Abels</hi> Martyrdome; glorious <hi>Joſephs</hi> irons were more pretious then the golden tyres of his Miſtreſs; <hi>Moſes</hi> reeds were more ſure then <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Cedars; <hi>Davids</hi> Cave in the Deſert more ſafe then the Towers of <hi>Saul; Elijahs</hi> Raven a more comfortable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyour then all the Officers of <hi>Jezabel; Micaiahs</hi> priſon was the Guard-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Angels, when <hi>Ahabs</hi> preſence was the Counſel-chamber of evil ſpirits; <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> Dungeon had more true light of comfort, then the ſhining ſtate of <hi>Zedekiah; Daniel</hi> was better guarded with the Lions, then <hi>Darius</hi> and the Medean Princes with their Janizaries; <hi>Johns</hi> head was more rich with the crown of his Martyrdom, then <hi>Herods</hi> with the Diadem of his Tetrarch; Chriſt at the Bar gave life and being to <hi>Pilate</hi> on the Bench, gave motion to thoſe hands that ſtruck him, to that tongue that condemn'd him, and in the mean while gave ſentence on the judge: the Diſciples were better pleaſed with

After this, who that had ſeen the Primitive Chriſtians, ſome broiled on Gridirons, others boyl'd in lead, ſome roaſted, others frozen to death, ſome flead, others torn with horſes, ſome craſht in pieces by the teeth of lions, others caſt down from high rocks to the ſtakes, ſome ſmiling on the wheel, others in the flame, all wearying their Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and ſhaming their Tyrants with their patience, would not have ſaid, of all things I would not be a Chriſtian?</p>
               <p>Yet even this while were theſe poor torturing ſtocks higher then their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutours, dying victors, yea victors of death, never ſo glorious as when they began not to be; in gaſping crowned, in yielding up the ghoſt more then conquerours. Judge not therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to appearance: Afflictions they are the lot of Gods people here, their crown is hereafter, and by them are they fitted for the crown. Iron is never cleaner, then when it comes out of the furnace; nor brighter, then when it hath been under the ſharp teeth of the file.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98496:99"/>The ſun never ſhines clearer, then when it comes from under a cloud; no coal more hot, then that which hath been cover'd with aſhes. Though innocency be ſhaded in the obſcurity of priſons, yet nevertheleſs ſhe comes forth in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, radeating with glory. <hi>God cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſeth every ſon whom he loveth;</hi> the Son of his love was perfected by afflictions, he bore his Croſs before he wore his Crown: The ſtones of the Temple were firſt hewen in the mountain before they were ſet in the building: The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the Law were firſt ſlain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were offered: The veſſels of the Sanctuary were firſt to paſſe the fire before they were put to any ſervice; ſo muſt Gods lively ſtones, [1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.] reaſonable ſacrifices, [<hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1.] veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of honour, [2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2 22.] paſs the hammer, the knife, and the fire of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, before they can be fit for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters uſe. God if in his divine wiſdom he thought it beſt for us, could bring his ſervants to glory without theſe trialls, but that after our troubles here we ſhall be the better able to prize our reſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: ſhould we have a glut of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98496:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>here, we ſhould be ſo wedded to this world, that we ſhould not take pains to enquire after a better. Gods people never ſo devout, as when exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with afflictions. <hi>It is good for me that I have been in trouble</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>for thereby have I known thy ſtatutes,</hi> Pſalm 119.71. Adverſity, though it be more horrid in the view, yet proſperity is more dangerous in the in the event. A Summers ſun-ſhine is the mother of more diſeaſes then a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Froſt; the one ſeeks to make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt on our Vertue by force, and that makes us (like a beſieged City) fortifie our ſelves more ſtrongly for a Reſiſtance; the other by the treaties of Peace, by the tribute of Gifts, ſeeks to bring our minds into ſervitude, and this melts our ſouls (our too too eaſie ſouls) into yelding. The fire burns hotter for being blown on by the cold winde, but the ſun ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on it well nigh puts it out: ſo Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue flames more brightly being blown on by the cold winde of adverſity, but is extinguiſht by the ſun-ſhine of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, like lime which is ſet on fire with water, and (as ſome report) is
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98496:100"/>quenched with oyl. That proſperity doth draw more to ruine then adverſity doth drive, the Prophet <hi>David</hi> intimates where he ſayes, <hi>A thouſand ſhall fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thee, and ten thouſand at thy right hand.</hi> There is ten to one whoſe vertue the right hand of proſperity doth choak more then the left hand of adverſity doth ſtarve. Afflictions are Gods troops (and he their Captain) intended for the perdition of the wicked, for the purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the godly; he will not lay any more on any of his ſervants then he ſhall enable them to bear; alas, the miſeries of this life are not worthy of the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the next, nor may theſe croſſes ſtand in competition with that crown; nor are the greateſt torments that can here be inflicted, comparable to thoſe endleſs and inſufferable tortures which the wicked ſhall be ſenſible of; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that a Saint can ſuffer here is but the malice of men and devils, the damned in hell ſhall taſte the wrath of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. The ſufferings of the Saint and the triumphs of the ſinner, are but for a moment, but the reward of the one, and the plagues of the other, are to eternity.

Groans and joyes in this life are both expiring, our troubles and our triumphs have both their ſetting. The diſtreſſes of the world are a ſhort and a ſudden tempeſt, and the delights of it are a ſhedding flower. Now (as an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Writer obſerves) who would not rather endure the Hell of a few dayes miſcries here, and enjoy the Heaven of eternal happineſs hereafter, then enjoy the Heaven of a few days pleaſure here, and endure the eternal miſeries of Hell hereafter. Temporal pleaſures are dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bought with the loſs of eternal, and temporal ſufferings are well requited with eternal pleaſures. That is a miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able happineſs that muſt end in ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries as muſt never end, and thoſe are happy miſeries that ſhall ſoon end in endleſs happineſs. This life is but a journey towards death, and but a ſhort one; and death is yet a ſhorter paſſage to a longer and a better life. That life
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98496:101"/>of joyes is worth the wiſhing that ſhall never have an end, and that end of our life is full as worthy of our wiſhes that ſhall begin the joyes of that endleſs life; and that end muſt be ere long, for life is ſhort. <hi>Man that is born of a woman is but of few dayes, and full of trouble:</hi> He is of few dayes, that he might not live too long in trouble; and his dayes are full of trouble, that he might not long for more of them then a few. Mans dayes are full of trouble, that a few might ſerve his turn, and make him wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them; and his dayes of trouble are but few, that he might not be too much wearied with them. If it be mans miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that his few dayes are full of trouble, 'tis Gods mercy that mans days of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are but few. The few dayes of mans life are full of trouble, that man might be daily minded of his duty, in ſeeking after another, a better life: and mans dayes of trouble are but few, that man may not be wearied ſo as to leave ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the other life, before that this doth leave him. What but the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and glory of that better life held up the ſpirits of Gods afflicted ſervants
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98496:102"/>in their greateſt ſufferings in this? 'Twas the recompence of reward that <hi>Moſes</hi> had reſpect to, which made him ſpurn at the treaſures of Egypt, and refuſed to be called the ſon of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter, and to ſlight all the diſcouragements and afflictions which he here met with. Let the miſeries therefore which accompany mortality wean us from all fondneſſe towards this life preſent, and the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of life eternal make us the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to long after that. The thoughts of the Elizian happineſſe did ſo encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage a poor Grecian (a meer Pagan) at the inſtant of his death, that he rejoyced much to think of going to <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and other learned Philoſophers: to <hi>Olympus</hi> and other skilful Muſicians, to <hi>Hecataeus;</hi> and other approved Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to <hi>Homer</hi> the prince of Poets, and other famous Wits that were his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; that Poetical Paradiſe the Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zian Field could make a Pagan give his <hi>longum vale</hi> to this preſent world with notable reſolution, and ſhall not the real pleaſures of the celeſtial Paradiſe, the fulneſs of joy in the glorious preſence of God, encourage a Chriſtian at his
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98496:102"/>death to depart as comfortably as a faithleſſe Grecian? Shall fantaſie in an Heathen be more powerful then faith in a Chriſtian? Is not the company as good which we believe to be at Gods right hand, as that which he imagined to be in <hi>Elizio campo,</hi> and are not the joys as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and as great? Well therefore may a Saint chear up himſelf at his departure by thinking of his going to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Saint, <hi>James,</hi> Saint <hi>John,</hi> and to all that glorious company of Apoſtles; and of his going to <hi>Elias,</hi> and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and to <hi>Daniel,</hi> and all that goodly fellowſhip of the Prophets; and of his going to Saint <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> the Proto Martyr, and to <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and to <hi>Juſtinus,</hi> and to our <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and our <hi>Ridley,</hi> and our <hi>Hooper,</hi> and our <hi>Taylor,</hi> and all that noble army of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs; and of his going to that Reverend Patriarch <hi>Abraham,</hi> the father of the faithful, and to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to all the holy Patriarchs; and of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the holy Angels, and Arch-An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and Thrones, and Powers, and Principalities, and to the ſpirits of all juſt men made perfect. Who can think
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98496:103"/>of being thus tranſported, and not be tranſported with the very thoughts of it. Surely it muſt needs be a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatory <hi>Viaticum</hi> to the ſoul of a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saint, to think of exchanging Earth for Heaven, and the ſordid company of ſinners for the ſweet ſociety of Saints. And this is it which makes the Saint en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain death as a friend, whom the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner fears as an enemy. The Saints of God in all Ages have lookt upon him as a friend, becauſe by him they have been wafted to glory. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſing when he was told his laſt. <hi>Elijah</hi> had his <hi>Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit,</hi> he deſir'd his God to take away his life. Old <hi>Simeon</hi> craved a diſmiſſion, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> a diſcharge. In the times of Perſecution how did the Martyrs run in troops to the flames, even to the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and admiration of their Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, which made a mortal Enemy to Chriſtianity in the dayes of Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> (who ſpeaking of ſome of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians and of the glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs that then ſuffered) bade a vengeance on them, for he thought they took de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in burning, and that they long'd for death. I ſhould ſwell this Volumn
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98496:103"/>too big, if I ſhould here inſert the laſt ſayings of dying Saints, who expreſt as much willingneſſe to be diſrob'd of their mortality, as ever they did to put off their cloaths to go to reſt: And no marvel, for death to a righteous man is but as a door to let him into glory, to ſuch endleſſe glory, as I ſhall not here ſtand to inſiſt of; for with a diſcourſe of that everlaſting happineſſe I ſhall cloſe the Book, and for the preſent leave it to fall on a worſe Subject.</p>
               <p>We'l now come to the ſinner, who (as we have ſeen already) ſeems by his outward proſperity to be the onely happy man, as having the world at will, and all things in it at his command; but alas (notwithſtanding all this) we ſhall finde that he and happineſs are at a great diſtance, if we but ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhortneſs of his joyes, and the eternity of his miſeries; that this is all the heaven he is ever like to have, he hath his portion in this life, and theſe ſhort pleaſures to end in endleſs tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

What more woeful then a ſinners welfare It is for ſlaughter that the Oxe is fatned, eaſe ſlayes the ſimple, and the proſperity of fools ſhall deſtroy them, they ſpend their dayes in wealth, and end their dayes in woe; their merry dance deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines in a miſerable downfall; the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners cup of honey is mixt with dregs of gall. He loves his belly well that with <hi>Eſau</hi> will ſell his birth-right for Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. I had rather beg my bread with <hi>Lazarus,</hi> then my water with <hi>Dives.</hi> In what ſlippery places hath God ſet wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men? He that now thinks himſelf as high as heaven, knows not how ſoon he ſhall be laid as low as hell; and he that is now carouzing and quaffing with his dammy Blades, and pampering his guts with the left hand bleſſings, knows not how ſuddenly he ſhall be plac't at the left hand of that Judge, who ſhall give to all their right, and ſend him and his crew to yell out their late Lamentations
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98496:104"/>in <hi>Tophet. Zophar</hi> (though none of the beſt men himſelf) could tell <hi>Job, that the triumphing of the wicked is but ſhort, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment,</hi> like the thorns in the fire, the bubble in the water, the flowers in the earth, or the clouds in the air, they blaze and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, they flouriſh and fade, they vaniſh and fly away. A candle burns more brightly, when neareſt the end, and the wicked are in greateſt pomp, when neareſt their ruine; witneſſe thoſe ſad examples of <hi>Abſalon, Jezabel, Haman, Herod,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that his joyes here are but like a fit of muſick before a fearful exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, or a <hi>Syrens</hi> ſong before a diſmal ſtorm; and of the ſhort time he hath here to frollick it, how often is he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted by Gods judgements from without, and by his own conſcience from within. Firſt from without, God oftentimes meets with the ſinner here, to put him in minde of what he ſhall feel hereafter; and that if he will not take warning by this, he ſhall be paid to purpoſe in a worſe place. As a Saint looks upon afflictions from God as the gentle chaſtiſements of a loving Father;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98496:105"/>the ſinner looks upon them as the ſevere puniſhments of an angry Judge, and as a ſad preſage or preface of thoſe inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable miſeries he ſhall finde in hell. 2. From within his guilty conſcience often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proves as a cord to ſtrangle his joyes, and to mar his mirth. Did not <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren experiment this in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> in his houſe of Ivory, and <hi>Belſhazar</hi> amidſt his ſenſualities; this is it that tells him of his paſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and future miſeries, which ſo much diſtracts him, that it makes him afraid both of himſelf and others, ever fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful leſt ſome juſt hand ſhould cut off his happineſſe with his life. Our <hi>Richard</hi> the Third after the murther of his two innocent Nephews had fearful dreams, inſomuch, that he did often leap out of his bed in the dark, and catching his ſword, (which alwayes naked ſtuck by his ſide) he would go diſtractedly about the chamber, every where ſeeking out the cauſe of his own occaſioned diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet. And <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth of <hi>France,</hi> after the Pariſian Maſacre, was ſo inwardly terrified, that he was every night laid to ſleep, and wakened again
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98496:105"/>with a ſet of Muſicians. Alas what happineſſe is it to have a houſe of Cedar adorn'd both within and without with beaten gold, to have his cheſts lin'd with the Gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> to have the richeſt Robes that ere the ſun ſhin'd on, the largeſt Wardrobe, the coiceſt Cates, and the moſt deſir'd delights, that his way were ſpread with Roſes, and pav'd with Diamonds, when his roof is open to the thunderbolt of Heaven, and has a hell in his conſcience, and God for his enemy. But put the caſe the ſinner were not troubled with theſe outward calamities nor inward afrightments, yet he were (notwithſtanding this) ſtill mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable; for in the higheſt exaltation of his mirth, the very name of death cools his courage, and ſtrikes him through with terrours; he would not (if he might have his will) ever part with this world, (for he knows that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of happineſs to be found for them in the next) he could with all his heart accept of St. <hi>Peters</hi> motion, to build Tabernacles here, and live for ever; but alas that muſt not be, for put the caſe he ſees many go before him, his turn
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:98496:106"/>will come ſhortly after, old age will ſoon ſeize upon him, when his feet will be full of gouts, his back full of pain, his heart full of ſorrow, and his ſoul full of ſin, and now all his happineſs is blown over, as though it had never been; or if he could call to minde his paſt felicities, the thoughts of them would be ſo far from adminiſtering any comfort to him, that it would but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract him; and he does now begin to wiſh he had never been born, or elſe a longer leaſe of his life. 'Tis ſtoried of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh King of <hi>France,</hi> that he was ſo wedded to this life, that he prohibited the mention of the word Death in his Court; but alas death regards not the threats of Princes, nor the tears of Peaſants. The ſtouteſt man and greateſt Monarch that ever was, hath been forc't to ſubmit to him and his meſſengers. The honourable Garter cannot cure the Gout, nor the Chair of State eaſe the Choluck, nor a golden Diadem remove the headache. <hi>Nuga:</hi> the Scythian deſpiſing the rich preſents and ornaments that were ſent unto him by <hi>Michael Paleologus</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

No, this they cannot do, as <hi>Henry Beauford</hi> (that rich and wretched Cardinal) found by woful experience in the dayes of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. who perceiving death at hand, askt wherefore he ſhould dye, being ſo rich: if the whole Realm will ſave my life, I am able either by policy to get it, or by riches to buy it; Fie (quoth he) will not death be hired, will money do nothing. No, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in this caſe bears no maſtery, death (as the Jealous man) will not regard any ranſom, neither will he reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent though thou offer many gifts, [<hi>Prov.</hi> 6.25.] 'Twas but a vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of one who when he heard that his ſickneſs was deadly, and that he was for another world, call'd for a bag of gold and laid to his heart, (as if that which had ſolely ſwayed him in his life to the committing of many prepoſtrous actions, ſhould now do ſomething for him) but he finding no eaſe by it, threw it away, crying it would not do. Nor was he leſs ridiculous, who being ready to expire, clapt a twenty ſhillings piece

I muſt now leave you, there is no remedy. I tremble to think in how ſad a manner the wicked leaves the world, to think what a ſad fit of trembling doth ſurprize him, when the cruel Sergeants and merlileſs Officers of the King of Terrors do arreſt him (as it were) in the Devils name, when death ſhall come with a writh of <hi>Habeas corpus,</hi> and the Devil with a writh of <hi>Habeas animam,</hi> when the cold Earth muſt have his Body, and hot Hell hold his Soul; Reader, now tell me which is the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man. <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour when his ſoul was ready to fly from his body, beſpake it thus, <hi>O animula, vagula, blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula,

               <p>Laſtly, To my Readers in general, Let me caution you to take notice of Gods Omnipotency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Omniſciency, and Juſtice, and our own Mortallity, and theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and ſeriouſly conſidered, may be a motive to ſtartle us from the very thoughts of thoſe ſins that we commit with greedineſs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, his Omniſciency, Remember that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98496:110"/>he is an all-ſeeing God that diſcovers all our actions and beholds all our wayes, to whom the day and the night, the darkneſs and the light are both alike. If we dare not commit our beaſtly ſins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of men, how dare we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to commit them before him that is able everlaſtingly to damn us, and throw our ſouls into Tophets endleſs flames.</p>
               <p>Secondly, his Omnipotency, Let us adumbrageouſly fancy (as one hath it) the Firmament to be his face, the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing Sun his right eye, the Moon his left, the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Winds the breath of his noſtrils, the Lightning and Tempeſts the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled actions of his ire, the Froſt and Snow his frowns, that Heaven is his throne, the Earth his footſtool that he is in all things, that his Omnipotency fills all the vacuities of Heaven, Earth, and Sea; that by his power he can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girdle and let looſe the ſeas impetuous waves to orewhelm and bury this low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Univerſe in their vaſte wombs in a moment; that he can let drop the Azure Canopy, (which hath nothing above it, whereto it is perpendicularly knit) or hurl thunderbolts through the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98496:110"/>tumerous clouds, to paſh us precipitate through the center into the loweſt dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of hell, and that all the creatures in their ſeveral ranges are as ſo many Regiments of the great King, and that with the meaneſt of theſe he can avenge himſelf on ſinners, as he did on <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh, Herod,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the next place let's acknowledge his Juſtice. Remember that he is a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God, a perfect hater of ſin, and will bring every work to judgement.</p>
               <p>And laſt of all, that we take notice of our own Mortality, and let the thoughts of that debar us from ſinning; we know not whether we ſhall live to ſee another day, and ſhall we be found ſinning on our laſt. Let the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that which will certainly once come, put us in a poſture of preparation for its coming; and ſince that upon this moment depends our either everlaſting woe or welfare, let's loſe no time: For as the Poet no leſs ſweetly then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly ſung, who knows o're night that he next morn ſhall breath. Therefore take <hi>Davids</hi> early in the morning, not the Devils ſtay till to morrow; think
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:98496:111"/>not to be accepted in thy makers preſence one day, if thou crammeſt the devil with thy ſap of ſtrength &amp; full, gorge him with the pureſt fruits of thy ſinewy virility, if at laſt (when thou art not able to do God or the devil ſervice) thou comeſt limping on Times tottering Crutches to preſent unto him the offall husks and moroſity of thy doting decrept age. Think eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day thy laſt, and ſpend it as if it were ſo; for we know that God will bring us to judgement: yet we know not when, nor in what year, nor in what moneth of the year, nor in what week of the moneth, nor in what day of the week, nor in what hour of the day, nor in what minute of the hour, nor in what moment of that minute; for he will come like a thief in the night ſuddenly, before with a wink thou canſt lock up thine eye, or within thy brain create the nimbleſt thought; the apprehenſion of which muſt needs ſtir us up to live in Gods fear, ſo ſhall we dye in his favour, and reſt in his peace, and riſe in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and reign (with him) in his glory, world without end.</p>

               <p>HAppineſſe is the mark and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which every man aims at, the next thing that is ſought after being, is being happy; where <hi>David</hi> begins his Pſalms, we all hope to end (and that's with bleſſedneſs) and no way to reach that but holineſs. That holineſſe is the way to happineſſe, or that the godly man is the truly happy man, I have already ſufficiently manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my laſt Diſcourſe, and therefore ſhall be the more ſparing here in my Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations: (for I would not take the pains o're again to prove what is proved
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:98496:112"/>already) but happineſſe is ſuch a ſubject, that I could willingly dwell upon, and fill a large Volumn with a diſcourſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, (deſiring that my portion may reſt here) but I am confin'd to ſuch nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row limits, both of time and paper, that I cannot inſiſt long on any one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; I ſhall therefore briefly ſtrike at that which is here chiefly intended, and before I have worn my Readers patie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence quite out, ſhall draw to a concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That the godly man is the happy (and onely happy) man will be further manifeſted in the end, (after the end of all things) but firſt in this life we will prove him happy here, as well as hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (in this world as well as the world to come) though not ſo happy here as there. Neither proſperity nor adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity can come amiſſe to him, though the times vary, his happineſſe is ſtill the ſame, (like his God that changes not) all things ſtill work together for good to him; and albeit he hath no peroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive above the ſinner from thoſe two beds of mankinde, (of ſickneſſe and the grave) his priviledge lies another way. No Kings (except ſuch) hath like pero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:98496:112"/>to the Saints; God is their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Chriſt their Brother, the Holy Ghoſt their Comforter, Angels their Guardians, Saints their Aſſociates, Death their deſire, the Grave their reſt, the Bar their joy, God their portion, the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty their propriety, Heaven their home, Eternity their term; before death their perogative is much, at it more, after it moſt; but from death and diſeaſes none, by death they have, from it not. Put the caſe that God permits wicked men to ride over him, and men and devils to uſe their utmoſt extremity to him, which is to put his dayes to a ſhameful and a painful period (for the ſhame Chriſt hath taken that away, and for the pain that will ſoon end in endleſſe pleaſures,) what unhappineſſe in this, when all they do or can do, is but to open the priſon-doors of his body to let out his ſoul to fly to reſt; from the labour of the ſervant to the joy of the maſter, from the work to the reward, and from the croſſe to the crown; there to ſolace it ſelf in thoſe rivers of pleaſures at Gods right hand, whileſt his precious aſhes are preſerved as in a ſafe ſtore-houſe, till the laſt trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:98496:113"/>ſhall ſhall alarm it, to give its belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved companion the meeting to be made eternally happy together, never to part more, (a Saint at his death is aſſured that a few moments will bring his departing ſoul to endleſſe happineſſe, and that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And now judge Reader, whether I may not upon good conſideration ſay, that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe is gain. I know there are ſome (and they ſuch whoſe hopes extend not further then this life) that invert this ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tell us that gain is godlineſs, and no happineſſe without gain, (their ſordid gain) and albeit it I have ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exploded this errour in my laſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I ſhall now notwithſtanding more fully (if that may be) give a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation in this, as ye will the more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehend, if ye minde the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The longeſt day with have a night, and the longeſt life will have an end. Let the ſinner live as long as he can, a miſerable period will at laſt be put to his ſinful dayes, and that period will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide this controverſie. Thoſe who in their life were the <hi>Diana's</hi> of the people,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:98496:113"/>that ſeem'd the moſt high and happy, will at their death (but more clearly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward) appear moſt miſerable, as they have ſpent their dayes in the unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able works of darkneſſe, ſo they ſhall finde but an unprofitable reward for their works, (they ſhall for their pains meet with ſuch pains as ſhall never have a period.) The Devil comes now to expect his due, (that as he was their ſlave for a time upon earth, they may eternally be his vaſſals in a worſe place) that as they did the works of darkneſſe, and workt for the Prince of darkneſſe, now receive their portion in utter darkneſſe. There's no denying or forſwearing of bargains, no talk of circumventing this experienced Politician; the richeſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, nor the loudeſt cryes, nor the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt tears, nor the greateſt threats, nor the humbleſt intreaties ſhall not ſerve the turn. The uſurers gold cannot ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome him, nor the mighty mans honour priviledge him; thoſe that ſhut up their bowels of compaſſion from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhall finde nothing but tyranny from him.

The Devil is the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Hell, and thither the Judge commands them: Take them Jaylour, ſaith the Judge, take them Devil, and keep them till the general Judgement, that then their miſeries may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated; and ſuffer in ſoul and body as they ſinned in both.</p>
               <p>The end comes when the earth ſhall tremble, and the foundations of the hills ſhall be ſhaken; when the Sun ſhall be turn'd into darkneſs, and the Moon into blood, to uſher in the coming of that day; at which time, how wilt thou be beleagur'd with anguiſh and horror, when thou ſhalt behold with thy mortal eyes the Cataracts of Heaven unſluced,

Then indeed to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were ſomething, but that will not be, for Juſtice muſt now exact to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt farthing. 'Twill be too late to wiſh the mountains to fall upon thee, for they themſelves would (if poſſible) for fear ſhrink into their center. Alas, it cannot then be available to wooe the Waters to ſwallow thee, for they would be glad to exclaim their liquid ſubſtance, and be reduc't to a nullity.

When thou ſhalt ſee him that was once a Saviour, now a Judge (whoſe Knowledge is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, whoſe Power is infringible, and his Juſtice inflexible) of exceeding dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Majeſty, clothed in glorious apparel, and his body ſhining through it like ſparkling diamonds, his eyes like burning lamps, his face like flaſhing lightning, his arms and legs like inflamed braſs, his voice like the ſhout of a multitude (or of many waters) prepared (for thy idle words, evil deeds, time miſpent, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ill govern'd) to paſs the ſentence upon thee, againſt whom thou haſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed; and he thy umpire, whom by many offences thou haſt made thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And in order to a full and clear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of Juſtice, a final ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be made, (no hypocrite ſhall cloſely lurk here among the Saints (the Gold ſhall be taken from the Droſs, and the Silver from the Tin, the Tares from the Wheat, and the Corn from the Chaff, the Sheep from the Goats, the Vile from the Precious, and the Elect from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, and plac't on each ſide the Judge; thoſe on the left hand, to be

How will it then perplex thy afflicted ſoul, to ſee thoſe on the Judges right hand, whom thou contemneſt as inferiour to the dogs of thy flock, who ſhall now be one of that Jury that ſhall confirm thy condemnation, and applaud the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Judge: here ſhall be a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Audit, the Widows tears, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans cryes ſhall be here regarded; what wouldſt thou now give for a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that were a jewel of price; then Chriſtian graces ſhall be more precious then natural gifts.

The godly ſhall rejoyce, and the reprobate howl; then ſhall baſe apparel be glorious, and proud attire infamous; then ſhall all black and diabolical deſigns perpetrated in darkneſſe be made viſible, and the moſt retiredſt actions and tranſactions that ever were huddled up in the world (with the greateſt privacy) be expoſed to the open view both of men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. Then if ever (as one ingeniouſly hath it) naked breaſts and black ſpots ſhall be in faſhion, when all things ſhall be naked and bare, and the ſinner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear like the Leopard full of ſpots.</p>
               <p>Then ſhall it appear who have been the Idolaters, whoſe God was their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and gold their hope, and fleſh their arm, that with the French fool would not have left their part in <hi>Paris</hi> for their part in Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>Then ſhall it appear who have been the ſwearer and common perjut'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who have ſet a brazen face on a

               <p>Then ſhall it appear who have been the <hi>Ahabs</hi> that have killed <hi>Naboth</hi> for his vineyard, and who the <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> (the make-bates) that hated their brethren with a perfect hatred, (whoſe hand was againſt every man, and every mans hand againſt them.)</p>
               <p>Then ſhall it appear who have been the <hi>Machiavels</hi> that have neglected thoſe pretious opportunities Providence put into their hands, to advance the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and the good of Nations, for their own baſe intereſts, (raiſing themſelves out of the ruine of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.)</p>
               <p>Then ſhall it appear who have lorded it over their brethren, (more righteous then they) and maliciouſly perſecuted, (for no other cauſe then filthy lucre ſake) to the temporal undoing both of them and their poſterity. (If any that read this Book (as 'tis poſſible ſome may, with prejudice againſt the Author) are guilty of this, let them reſpect me

               <p>Then ſhall it appear who have been the nice Non-conformiſt, that not out of tenderneſs of conſcience, or zeal to Gods Glory, but for ſedition ſake and vain glory would be of the ſingular number.</p>
               <p>Then ſhall it appear who have under pretences of zeal jugled their brethren out of their eſtates, and term'd thoſe malignant, whom the righteous Judge ſhall proclaim the contrary.</p>
               <p>Then ſhall it appear who have been at the charge of clothing with ſilk and gold the images of men, and let the poor go naked who is the image of God.</p>
               <p>Then it ſhall appear who have worn a croſs on the belly, while the belly was an enemy to the Croſs of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Then ſhall it appear who have ſlily ſlided into Brothel-houſes in the dark to commit their obſcenities, and return'd unſeen (of men) and preſently buſied with their <hi>Pater noſters,</hi> and who have maintain'd thoſe Shambles of forbidden fleſh with their Pimps, Panders, &amp;c. and other deviliſh and unquoth titles which
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:98496:118"/>then ſhall be known.</p>
               <p>Then ſhall it appear who have blinded the eye of Juſtice with bribes, and ſhut their ears againſt the clamorous cryes of the innocent; that made the Law a noſe of wax to turn and faſhion to their own private ends, to the diſparagement of Juſtice, and lamentable ſubverſion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an honeſt and upright Cauſe: their quirks, dilatory demurs, conveyances and connivances cannot quit them; for now whether they will or no, they muſt be removed with a Writ into the loweſt and darkeſt dungeon of damnation. For no bribes ſhall be taken in this Court, (here ſhall Juſtice be obtain'd without money) no relations ſhall take place here, (for there ſhall be no reſpect of perſons with this Judge) the great Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah ſhall now judge the world in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, [<hi>Acts</hi> 17.31.]</p>

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:98496:124"/>No ravenous Wolves in ſheeps clothing can creep by any Poſtern-gates into that fold, to flea or fleece the flock, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, feeding on them for feeding of them. Nothing that worketh any abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination can come there, and therefore every thing that tendeth towards the grand abomination of deſolation muſt needs be for ever excluded thence; the glory of all there muſt laſt for ever, and all in that glory muſt live for ever being free from ſin, they ſhall be from death; from death ſpiritual in it, from death temporal by it, and from death eternal for it; that preſence of the ever-living God doth ſet them free from all for ever; there is no dying, they that are there, are ſure to live for ever; the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints ſhall never be reduc't to a nullity; thoſe crowned perſonages ſhall not be folded up in a confuſed Chaos, death has no power here, they are free from the ſting of death and from the ſtroke, free from all tendencies unto death, and from all fears of dying. Now who would not gladly live in ſuch a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg'd place, where that boldeſt Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, Death, cannot come to arreſt. Such
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:98496:124"/>is the ſanctuary of Gods glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, that's free from all kinds of death, and free from unkinde Devils too, from Devils infernal, and Devils incarnate too.</p>
               <p>No evil Angels can aſcend from the bottomleſs pit into the preſence, to tempt any there to ſin, nor helliſh Furies to torment for ſinning in times paſt No Devil of the lower hell nor any of this wicked world above it, can finde any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance thither. There is indeed free quarter for Saints, but none for ſinners; the Free men of that City, and all the Denizons of that Kingdom, are always freed from all unwelcome troubleſome intruders; the ſpirit of ſtrife and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate can never thruſt the Devils myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cloven foot into that preſence to ſet Diviſions, to cauſe Diſtractions, to bring Deſtruction. No carnal pride can ever beget fond faſhioniſts in the ſtreets of that moſt holy City; nor ſpiritual pride breed up fantaſtical Factioniſts in thoſe Manſions. No hideous blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor filthy obſcenities, nor thump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oathes, not helliſh curſings, nor pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh cenſurings, are uſed by any in that
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:98496:125"/>preſence: all profane and black-mouth'd monſters of men are exiled for ever from that ſociety of Saints; and ſo are all inſinuating Sycophants and falſe-hearted Phariſees: that place ſhall be free from all evil, or tending to it; no evil company, no evil by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny no company of evil; no devils, not be devill'd men, no tempters, no tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors, nor any other infernals; no devils incarnate, either white or black; no kinde of death, either temporal or eternal; no kinde of wars, no kinde of woes, no kinde of ſufferings: ſurely they muſt needs be happy that are in ſuch a caſe.</p>
               <p>Yet let me tell you that it is not the abſence of evil alone that can make a man truly and fully happy, it may cauſe ſome joy, but not the fulneſs of joy, till the affluence of all good things be enjoyed with it. Now in the glorious preſence of God, there is not onely the abſence of all evil, but the preſence of all good: All things that are deſirable are there, and all things there are deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; there are profitable pleaſures and pleaſurable profits; things inconſiſtent
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:98496:125"/>here, are all coincident there; thoſe gifts that go not here together, are all united there; thoſe comforts which are divided here in ſeveral ſtreams, do meet all there as in their fountain (or rather in the ocean.) No one here may look to enjoy all good things, but all there do ever ſo.</p>
               <p>There are the precious Merchandices of all Cities, for that's the City of all precious Merchandices; there are the true Delights of all Countreys, for that's the true Countrey of all Delights. There are all the real Honours of the the Court that can never be loſt, and that's the right Court of Honour that can never be put down. There are all the true pleaſures of Paradiſe, for that's the true Paradiſe of all pleaſures. What does any of your ſouls take moſt delight in? what do you moſt of all deſire? there you may have it in the fulleſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and there enjoy it in the fineſt manner.</p>
               <p>There is to ſatisfie all deſires; do you deſire, or delight in Gold, or precious Stones, or coſtly Gems, or ſtately Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there's a City of pure Gold, clear
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:98496:126"/>as cryſtal, walled, and gated, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Jaſpers, and Saphires, and all ſorts of Pearls and precious ſtones, as St. <hi>John</hi> deſcribes it, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.18. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Or do you delight in glorious tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, and pompous ſhews; there are triumphs everlaſting, and the glory of all Nations ſhall flow into that City in triumphant manner, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.26. Or do you delight (as <hi>Maſſiniſſa</hi> and <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian</hi> did) in curious Gardens, in fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Orchards, in healthful Walks, in pleaſant Fountains; there is the Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Paradiſe, wherein the moſt curious and nice, had he a hundred times as many eyes as <hi>Argus,</hi> might employ them all at once with various curioſities, and tranſcendent rarities. All thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd Gardens of <hi>Adonis,</hi> and <hi>Alcinous</hi> of <hi>Po.</hi> and <hi>Tantalus,</hi> and the <hi>Heſperides</hi> could never boaſt (no not in any fiction of the Poets) of ſuch a living Fountain, as that which floweth in the middle of this Garden of Heaven, and affords the Water of life; nor yet of ſuch a Tree as that of Life, which bears twelve kinds of fruits, and brings forth every moneth,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:98496:126"/>as Saint <hi>John</hi> expreſſes, <hi>Revelations</hi> 22.1</p>
               <p>Or do you delight in, or deſire peace, there can you never want it; that new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is the true <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the bliſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful viſion of Peace, a City at Peace, and unity in it ſelf. There endleſs tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of peace are ſolemnized by all the Citizens; that's the place of peace, there's the Prince of peace, the Authour of peace, the Maker, the Creatour of it. There's the full enjoyment of that mother bleſſing, and all other bleſſings with it, the true God of peace is there, and the true peace of God which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all underſtanding. Or do you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire truth with peace, there are both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; the God of peace is the God of truth, and the truth of God is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed fully; the true worſhip of the moſt holy God is there eſtabliſhed, and the true God is worſhipped there in the beauty of holineſs. Or do you delight in the melody of curious muſick, there are ſoul-raviſhing Anthems chanted and warbled by the ſweeteſt of all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Quire in that Mother Church, that glorious Temple, Chriſts Church Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:98496:127"/>Or do you delight in eaſe and reſt from weariſome labours, there the true Chriſtian Sabbath is kept holy, whereof our Sunday Sabbath is but an adumbration, or preparatory Eve. Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem below hath ſix dayes for working, for one Sabbath day for reſt; but Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem above is free to ſanctifie an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Sabbath, as free from labour as from ſin.</p>
               <p>Or do you delight in the preſence of great Perſonages, there is the mighty and Almighty Monarch of Heaven and Earth, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; and there is his ſecond ſelf, his onely begotten Son, the Son of his love, in whom he is well pleaſed, his right hand Favorite, his Chriſt our Lord and Jeſus in the height of his honour inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with power to unlock the Exchequer of his Fathers richeſt favours, with the key of his eternal merits, and to deal them forth in glory to thoſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him in grace.</p>
               <p>In a word, there are all ſorts of rich delights; that endleſs fountain can never be drawn dry, for there is all in all to draw them forth; there are ſoul-raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:98496:127"/>joyes, and ſoul-admiring felicities, everlaſting joyes, (without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted mutation) ſuch are thoſe divine Raptures, which ſhall flow from that communion they enjoy in that glorious preſence with unſpotted Angels and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints. I ſhall ſhut up all in the words of the Apoſtle, [1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.] <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, or is it poſſible for the minde of man to conceive the glory that God hath laid up for them that love him.</hi> It being beyond the power of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals to imagine the glory of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the brightneſs of that Diadem, and the ſplendour of that Crown, (which no hand of treaſon ſhall be ever able to take off the Wearers head.) Having now brought this happy Pilgrim to the New JERUSALEM, where I leave him to take his fill of thoſe everlaſting plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: To which place (through the merits of that all-ſufficient and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Redemption) may I and my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in his good time arrive.</p>
